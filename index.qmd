## How to reproduce everything

If you wish to reproduce the results of this study, all you need are available in the `quarto` folder, the `mod` folder and the `bootstrap` folder.

Instructions :

-   Whether or not you want to run the models again, please delete the folders from the `quarto` folder that end by `_cache` or `_files` and delete all the figures present in the `fig` folder.
    -   If you do not want to run the models again, move on to the next step
    -   If you wish to run the models again, please delete the files in `mod/model_choice`and in `mod` (keep the arborescence)
    -   If you wish to run the bootstrap again (warning : long calculations of about 24 h on a Macbook M2), please delete the `.RData` files in the `bootstrap` folder. Run it again by just executing the `Bootstrap_VI.R` script.
-   Then, you can render again all .qmd files from the `quarto` folder in the alphabetical order of their name.
