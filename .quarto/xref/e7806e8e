{"entries":[{"caption":"Different scenarios of how pesticides exposure may alter individual differences in growth under the general hypothesis that average growth is reduced by the exposition. Case 1 describes a diminution of individual differences that may be due to the additional constraints from the exposition, leading to a low overlap in growth trajectories between the two groups. Case 2 describes an amplification of individual differences that may be due to the additional variation of individual responses to the fungicide exposure, leading to a strong overlap in growth trajectories between the two groups.","key":"fig-hyp","order":{"number":1,"section":[2,2,0,0,0,0,0]}}],"headings":["abstract","introduction"],"options":{"chapters":true}}
