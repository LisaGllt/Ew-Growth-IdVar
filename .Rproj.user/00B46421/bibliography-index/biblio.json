To this end a review on the state of scientific knowledge about the predictivity of combined effects is collated. Central in this context is the reference model of Concentration Addition which allows extrapolating combined effects for mixtures based on knowledge about the effects of the components. Building on this, options for risk regulation are developed. Their applicability is considered in the context of those data that are currently available within the authorization process for biocide and plant protection products. Deficits with respect to a – scientifically sensible – homogeneous data base can often be overcome with pragmatic decisions if additional requirements for the authorization process are not an option. Tiered schemes to specifically account for combined effects during environmental risk assessment of biocide and plant protection product authorization are suggested, accompanied with a software tool for its implementation.",

            "abstract": "Soil plays a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. In the 1990s ecosystem services (ES) research focused on developing the concept and framework and only a few studies linked soil properties to ecosystem services. This study reviews the literature on the relationship between soils and ecosystem services and aims to contribute to the scientific understanding on soil and ecosystem services and their interrelations. Most studies have focused on provisioning and regulating ES relating to soil physico-chemical properties. Cultural services had only a few studies, and supporting services were mostly related to soil physico-chemical and biological properties. The number of ES papers increased rapidly after 2000 and in the past 5 years, regulating services such as carbon sequestration, climate and gas regulations, were commonly studied. Once the concept was established in the 1990s, studies focusing on the assessment, valuation, and payments of services became more prominent. Most soil-ES research is published in Geoderma. Soil scientists seems to be hesitant to use the term “ecosystem services” even if their research is devoted to linking soils to ecosystem services. We suggest that future ES research should focus on exploring soil functional diversity of soil biota and the spatial aspects of soil properties to lower level ecosystem services (e.g., water purification, gene pool, and climate regulation). Soil scientists should engage professionals from other disciplines to further promote the contribution of soils to ecosystem services delivery and human well-being. ES soil studies could be used in local and national policy development and program on natural resource use and management.",

            "abstract": "For the registration of Plant Protection Products (PPP), EU Regulation 1107/2009 requires the risk assessment of several groups of non-target terrestrial organisms (NTTOs). Currently different EU guidance documents for the risk assessment of PPPs to NTTOs including non-target arthropods, mammals and bees are being revised. In particular, guidance on the off-field exposure assessment was found to be inadequate or missing. To further develop this guidance, the off-field exposure of non-target arthropods and small mammals was characterised by defining and describing relevant environmental exposure routes like spray drift deposition, run-off, dust drift and atmospheric deposition. The current report has a focus on spray drift, the major exposure route for off-crop areas. Several aspects associated with spray drift deposition in a regulatory context are described. These include physical aspects, spray drift deposition curves, potential of different mitigation measures and the present regulatory practices of different EU Member States (MS) regarding spray drift deposition. Several data gaps are identified, for instance lacking spray deposition data on in-crop and off-crop plants as 3-dimensional structures. Another data gap involves a clear insight in crop development stages for various crops in different MS as a function of day-of-year. These and other data gaps led to a list of recommendations for future investigation. Finally, a procedure is presented for developing higher tier exposure scenarios for non-target terrestrial organisms for use in EU registration in a structured and transparent way. It is recommended to develop exposure scenarios for non-target terrestrial organisms in the EU by a Working Group that represents the EU Member States well, covering the diverse agronomic practices and agro-ecologic conditions. The procedure developed in this report can aid such a working group in structuring the work.",

            "abstract": "Suggestion for how the use of behavioral endpoints can improve in environmental risk assessment of chemicals. , Interest in behavioural ecotoxicology is growing, partly due to technological and computational advances in recording behaviours but also because of improvements of detection capacity facilitating reporting effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. The peer-reviewed literature now contains studies investigating the effects of chemicals, including pesticides and pharmaceuticals, on migration, dispersal, aggression, sociability, reproduction, feeding and anti-predator behaviours in vertebrates and invertebrates. To understand how behavioural studies could be used in regulatory decision-making we: (1) assessed the legal obstacles to using behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; (2) analysed the known cases of use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation; and (3) provided examples of behavioural endpoints of relevance for population level effects. We conclude that the only legal obstacle to the use of behavioural endpoints in EU chemicals regulation is whether an endpoint is considered to be relevant at the population level or not. We also conclude that ecotoxicity studies investigating behavioural endpoints are occasionally used in the EU chemicals regulation, and underscore that behavioural endpoints can be relevant at the population level. To improve the current use of behavioural studies in regulatory decision-making contribution from all relevant stakeholders is required. We have the following recommendations: (1) researchers should conduct robust, well-designed and transparent studies that emphasize the relevance of the study for regulation of chemicals; (2) editors and scientific journals should promote detailed, reliable and clearly reported studies; (3) regulatory agencies and the chemical industry need to embrace new behavioural endpoints of relevance at the population level.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The present study was conducted to assess three microevolutionary aspects of adaptation to pollution in Daphnia longispina populations historically exposed to an acid mine drainage from an abandoned pyrite mine: pollution mediated effects in acute tolerance to copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn); pollution‐mediated effects on genetic variability of tolerant and physiological traits related to fitness (feeding rates); and fitness costs of tolerance measured as genetic trade‐offs between tolerance and feeding rates under none and low levels of contamination. These objectives were addressed by comparing broad sense heritabilities and genetic correlations using up to 20 distinct clonal lineages randomly obtained from two populations: one located in a water reservoir contaminated by the acid mine drainage, and the other located in a nearby clean water reservoir. Results showed that only sensitive and resistant lineages to Cu were present in the reference and contaminated site, respectively. For Zn, however, both populations had a similar distribution pattern of sensitivities. Heritability values for tolerant and feeding traits across metal exposure levels was similar in both populations being in most cases greater than 50%. Fitness costs of tolerance were illustrated by lower feeding rates of the tolerant population compared to the reference one and negative genetic correlations between mean clonal feeding rates and median clonal survival time in control conditions (no added Cu or Zn). The results obtained thus support the view that tolerance to pollution is ecologically costly. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:939–946. © 2009 SETAC",

            "abstract": "Current scientific findings suggest a decline in the diversity and abundance of insects, including the honey bee Apis mellifera. The latter are facing high colony losses in several regions of the world such as Western Europe and the United States. Numerous studies suggest that the origin of bee colony decline is multi-causal and identify pesticides and pathogens as the main contributors to this decline. Co-exposure of honey bees to multiple pesticides and infection by multiple pathogens are common phenomena. However, research on the effects of pesticide mixtures has not been extensively developed. Thus, the thesis work has focused on determining the toxicity of pesticide mixtures, applied at environmental exposure levels, in the presence of pathogens. The choice was made to study the interactions between a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, an azole fungicide, difenoconazole, and a herbicide, glyphosate, in the presence of the pathogen Nosema ceranae. The results of the different studies, carried out during this thesis, reveal the complexity of the studies on pesticide mixtures. The work allowed us to notice that the effects of a pesticide mixture can vary according to the concentrations of the pesticides constituting the mixture. The increase of the number of substances and the level of exposure does not necessarily induce an increase of the toxicity of the mixture. Furthermore, the effects of the mixture may vary depending on the sequence of exposure to the different pesticides and the health status of the honey bees. Pesticide mixtures affect the physiological state of individuals as a result of a systemic response related to disturbances of general mechanisms such as oxidative stress. However, these three pesticides, alone and in mixtures, have no effect on the installation of the intestinal microbiota at environmental exposure levels.",

            "abstract": "Environmental contaminants are frequently encountered as mixtures, and the behavior of chemicals in a mixture may not correspond to that predicted from data on the pure compounds. This paper reviews current quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methodology for the analysis of mixture toxicity. Interactions of components in a mixture can cause complex and substantial changes in the apparent properties of its constituents, resulting in synergistic or antagonistic effects as opposed to the ideal reference case of additive behavior: concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) are two prominent reference models for the evaluation of joint activity, and both have mechanistic support from pharmacology. After discussing graphical tools for analyzing binary mixtures and joint effect indices suitable also for multicomponent mixtures, water solubility and hydrophobicity of mixtures are analyzed with respect to the property contributions of the individual components. With the former, small but significant deviations from ideal behavior are observed even for simple organics, whereas in the case of low concentrations, mixture hydrophobicity was found to agree approximately with the fractional contributions of the components. A variety of studies suggest that mixtures of compounds exerting only one (narcotic or specific) mode of action can be modeled satisfactorily by assuming CA, whereas the interaction of differently acting compounds tends to yield a less than CA joint activity. The QSARs have been used to predict concentrations of components in mixtures from joint effects and defined mixture ratios and have been developed to predict narcotic-type mixture toxicity from molecular descriptors that are calculated as composite properties according to the fractional concentrations of the mixture components. In the case of ionogenic compounds, initial results suggest that CA may serve as a firstorder approximation for the joint effect of un-ionized and ionized compound portions.",

            "abstract": "Environmental quality monitoring of water resources is challenged with providing the basis for safeguarding the environment against adverse biological effects of anthropogenic chemical contamination from diffuse and point sources. While current regulatory efforts focus on monitoring and assessing a few legacy chemicals, many more anthropogenic chemicals can be detected simultaneously in our aquatic resources. However, exposure to chemical mixtures does not necessarily translate into adverse biological effects nor clearly shows whether mitigation measures are needed. Thus, the question which mixtures are present and which have associated combined effects becomes central for defining adequate monitoring and assessment strategies. Here we describe the vision of the international, EU-funded project SOLUTIONS, where three routes are explored to link the occurrence of chemical mixtures at specific sites to the assessment of adverse biological combination effects. First of all, multi-residue target and non-target screening techniques covering a broader range of anticipated chemicals co-occurring in the environment are being developed. By improving sensitivity and detection limits for known bioactive compounds of concern, new analytical chemistry data for multiple components can be obtained and used to characterise priority mixtures. This information on chemical occurrence will be used to predict mixture toxicity and to derive combined effect estimates suitable for advancing environmental quality standards. Secondly, bioanalytical tools will be explored to provide aggregate bioactivity measures integrating all components that produce common (adverse) outcomes even for mixtures of varying compositions. The ambition is to provide comprehensive arrays of effect-based tools and trait-based field observations that link multiple chemical exposures to various environmental protection goals more directly and to provide improved in situ observations for impact assessment of mixtures. Thirdly, effect-directed analysis (EDA) will be applied to identify major drivers of mixture toxicity. Refinements of EDA include the use of statistical approaches with monitoring information for guidance of experimental EDA studies. These three approaches will be explored using case studies at the Danube and Rhine river basins as well as rivers of the Iberian Peninsula. The synthesis of findings will be organised to provide guidance for future solution-oriented environmental monitoring and explore more systematic ways to assess mixture exposures and combination effects in future water quality monitoring.",

The concentrations in the River Ruhr are 20 – 200 ng/l TCPP, 13 – 130 ng/l TCEP, about 50 ng/l TDCP, 10 – 200 ng/l TBEP and up to 40 ng/l TPP. The STP effluents exhibit concentrations up to 400 ng/l TCPP, 130 ng/l TCEP, about 120 ng/l TDCP and 500 ng/l TBEP, respectively. The main sources for the load of organophosphates are sewage treatment plants, but not all contribute equivalent to the amount of inhabitants they serve.",

            "abstract": "Ecologists are often interested in answering causal questions from observational data but generally lack the training to appropriately infer causation. When applying statistical analysis (e.g., generalized linear model) on observational data, common statistical adjustments can often lead to biased estimates between variables of interest due to processes such as confounding, overcontrol, and collider bias. To overcome these limitations, we present an overview of structural causal modeling (SCM), an emerging causal inference framework that can be used to determine cause-and-effect relationships from observational data. The SCM framework uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to visualize researchers’ assumptions about the causal structure of a system or process under study. Following this, a DAG-based graphical rule known as the backdoor criterion can be applied to determine statistical adjustments (or lack thereof) required to determine causal relationships from observational data. In the presence of unobserved confounding variables, an additional rule called the frontdoor criterion can be employed to determine causal effects. Here, we use simulated ecological examples to review how the backdoor and frontdoor criteria can return accurate causal estimates between variables of interest, as well as how biases can arise when these criteria are not used. We further provide an overview of studies that have applied the SCM framework in ecology. SCM, along with its application of DAGs, has been widely used in other disciplines to make valid causal inferences from observational data. Their use in ecology holds tremendous potential for quantifying causal relationships and investigating a range of ecological questions without randomized experiments.",

            "abstract": "Ecologists often rely on randomized control trials (RCTs) to quantify causal relationships in nature. Many of our foundational insights of ecological phenomena can be traced back to well-­designed experiments, and RCTs continue to provide valuable insights today. Although RCTs are often regarded as the “gold standard” for causal inference, it is important to recognize that they too rely on a set of causal assumptions that must be justified and met by the researcher to draw valid causal conclusions. We use key ecological examples to show how biases such as confounding, overcontrol, and collider bias can occur in experimental setups. In tandem, we highlight how such biases can be removed through the application of the structural causal model (SCM) framework. The SCM framework visualizes the causal structure of a system or process under study using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and subsequently applies a set of graphical rules to remove bias from both observational and experimental data. We show how DAGs can be applied across ecological experimental studies to ensure proper study design and statistical analysis, leading to more accurate causal estimates drawn from experimental data. Although causal conclusions drawn from RCTs are often taken at face value, ecologists are increasingly becoming aware that experimental approaches must be carefully designed and analyzed to avoid potential biases. By applying DAGs as a visual and conceptual tool, experimental ecologists can increasingly meet the causal assumptions required for valid causal inference.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides a generalised way to quantify how an organism assimilates and utilizes energy throughout its life cycle. Over 800 DEB models have been created to date, typically under the assumption of constant food supply. The Critically Endangered, semi-aquatic western swamp turtle occupies an ephemeral wetland environment in which food resources fluctuate from abundant to absent with the seasonal filling and drying of swamps. Approximately six months of each year are spent in aestivation underground when the swamps are dry and conditions are warm. We estimated DEB parameters for the western swamp turtle with the explicit incorporation of these seasonal fluctuations in food and temperature. A metabolic depression factor was applied during the aestivation stage, without which turtles lost both mass and length, and reserves were insufficient to reach puberty. The swamp turtle had a very high Arrhenius temperature, being almost 2.5-fold greater than that of the other Testudine species for which there are DEB models (typical Arrhenius temperatures are around 8000 K; western swamp turtle is 19,371 K). It also had the second highest somatic maintenance costs of the reptiles in the DEB “Add My Pet” collection, and the highest for Testudines. We explore these results in context of the “waste to hurry” hypothesis, which we suggest may apply for this species. We also consider how a DEB model for this species might be applied in its future conservation and management.",

            "abstract": "The dose makes the poison”. This principle assumes that once a chemical is cleared out of the organism (toxicokinetic recovery), it no longer has any effect. However, it overlooks the other process of reestablishing homeostasis, toxicodynamic recovery, which can be fast or slow depending on the chemical. Therefore, when organisms are exposed to two toxicants in sequence, the toxicity can differ if their order is reversed. We test this hypothesis with the freshwater crustacean Gammarus pulex and four toxicants that act on different targets (diazinon, propiconazole, 4,6-dinitro-ocresol, 4-nitrobenzyl chloride). We found clearly different toxicity when the exposure order of two toxicants was reversed, while maintaining the same dose. Slow toxicodynamic recovery caused carry-over toxicity in subsequent exposures, thereby resulting in a sequence effect−but only when toxicodynamic recovery was slow relative to the interval between exposures. This suggests that carry-over toxicity is a useful proxy for organism fitness and that risk assessment methods should be revised as they currently could underestimate risk. We provide the first evidence that carry-over toxicity occurs among chemicals acting on different targets and when exposure is several days apart. It is therefore not only the dose that makes the poison but also the exposure sequence.",

Humanity needs tools to identify those combinations of man-made chemicals and organisms most likely to cause problems. In other words: which of the millions of species are at risk from pollution? And which of the tens of thousands of chemicals contribute most to the risk? We identified our poor knowledge on physiological modes of action (how a chemical affects the energy allocation in an organism), and how they vary across species and toxicants, as a major knowledge gap. We also find that the key to predictive ecotoxicology is the systematic, rigorous characterization of physiological modes of action because that will enable more powerful in vitro to in vivo toxicity extrapolation and in silico ecotoxicology. In the near future, we expect a step change in our ability to study physiological modes of action by improved, and partially automated, experimental methods. Once we have populated the matrix of species and toxicants with sufficient physiological mode of action data we can look for patterns, and from those patterns infer general rules, theory and models.",

The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012. In June 2023, the European Commission sent a mandate confirming the need to adopt and publish a conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dimoxystrobin excluding the full assessment of endocrine-disrupting properties, containing all the results of the peer review process related to the renewal of approval as well as the assessment of the application for MRL for oilseed rapeseed, poppy seed, mustard seed and gold of pleasure seed, and the MRL application addressing the confirmatory data identified during the MRL review under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of dimoxystrobin as a fungicide on oilseed rape and sunflower. MRLs were assessed in rapeseeds, poppy seed, mustard seed and Gold of pleasure seed. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment and the proposed MRLs, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are presented where identified.",

This increase in resistance to the present antimicrobial agents led the researchers to find some alternative and more efficient drugs which can fight with the resistant microorganisms more effectively. Hence, in silico approach is used to design some novel drugs against various targets of microorganisms. For effective virtual screening of the drugs, there is a need to know about the chemical structure and properties of the antimicrobial agents. Therefore, we have prepared a comprehensive database as a platform for the researcher to search for possible lead molecules. Antimicrobial chemotherapeutics database (ACD) is comprised of ~4100 synthetic antimicrobial compounds as well as ~1030 active antimicrobial peptides.",

Within this approach the effect of a mixture is built up from the effects of the individual components making up the mixture. Understanding effects of mixtures is essential as it is impossible to assess effects of all possible mixtures experimentally.",

            "abstract": "In ecological risk assessment of chemicals, hazard identification and hazard characterisation are most often based on ecotoxicological tests and expressed as summary statistics such as No Observed Effect Concentrations or Lethal Concentration values and No Effect Concentrations. Considerable research is currently ongoing to further improve methodologies to take into account toxico kinetic aspects in toxicological assessments, extrapolations of toxic effects observed on individuals to population effects and combined effects of multiple chemicals effects. In this context, the principles of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB), namely the conserved allocation of energy to different life-supporting processes in a wide variety of different species, have been applied successfully to the development of a number of DEB models. DEB models allow the incorporation of effects on growth, reproduction and survival within one consistent framework. This review aims to discuss the principles of the DEB theory together with available DEB models, databases available and applications in ecological risk assessment of chemicals for a wide range of species and taxa.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms can alter the soil environment by changing soil properties. They have great potentiality to enhance soil physical properties like bulk density, infiltrability, hydraulic conductivity, porosity, aggregate stability. Due to this ability they are only species which plays significant role in pedoturbation. Similarly, their role in nutrient cycling and organic matter breakdown is of unique interest. Earthworm cast fortified with the microbial population. Increasing microbial activity in soil, increases the nutrient mineralization and release. Earthworm activity enhances root distribution so that immobile macro nutrients like phosphorous and other micronutrients, which are absorbed by plant through root interception, are easily available to the plants. Hence, earthworms play important role in bioturbation, they are considered as ’soil engineer.’ However, their activity differs with the agroecosystems. Their population density is more in reduced tillage system than conventional tillage system, aerobic condition than anaerobic conditions, grasslands than forest. Low population of earthworm was found in dry land agroecosystems. But earthworm presence in extreme environment is not studied well yet. So, this paper was reviewed to explore the role of earthworm as soil and ecosystem engineer. This was already established fact but main aim of this paper is to collect the related information and conclude the future research prospects to strengthen the earthworm role as soil and ecosystem engineer.",

            "abstract": "Diffuse pollution of the environment by pesticides has become a major soil threat to non-target organisms, such as earthworms for which declines have been reported. However some endogeic species are still abundant and persist in intensively cultivated fields, suggesting they become tolerant to long-term anthropogenic pressure. We thus considered the working hypothesis that populations of Aporrectodea caliginosa earthworms from conven­ tionally managed fields developed a tolerance to pesticides compared with those from organically managed fields. To investigate this hypothesis, we studied earthworm populations of the same genetic lineage from soils that were either lowly or highly contaminated by pesticides to detect any constitutive expression of differentially expressed molecular pathways between these populations. Earthworm populations were then experimentally exposed to a fungicide—epoxiconazole—in the laboratory to identify different molecular responses when newly exposed to a pesticide. State-of-the-art omics technology (RNA sequencing) and bioinformatics were used to characterize molecular mechanisms of tolerance in a non-targeted way. Additional physiological traits (respi­ rometry, growth, bioaccumulation) were monitored to assess tolerance at higher levels of biological organiza­ tion. In the present study, we generated the de novo assembly transcriptome of A. caliginosa consisting of 64,556 contigs with N50 = 2862 pb. In total, 43,569 Gene Ontology terms were identified for 21,593 annotated se­ quences under the three main ontologies (biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions). Overall, we revealed that two same lineage populations of A. caliginosa earthworms, inhabiting similar pedoclimatic environment, have distinct gene expression pathways after they long-lived in differently managed agricultural soils with a contrasted pesticide exposure history for more than 22 years. The main difference was observed regarding metabolism, with upregulated pathways linked to proteolytic activities and the mitochon­ drial respiratory chain in the highly exposed population. This study improves our understanding of the long-term impact of chronic exposure of soil engineers to pesticide residues.",

            "abstract": "The use of pesticides in crop fields may have negative effects on soil Oligochaeta Annelida, i.e., earthworms and enchytraeids, and thus affect soil quality. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of two commercial fungicide formulations on the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa and the enchytraeid Enchytraeus albidus in a natural soil. The fungicides were Cuprafor micro® (copper oxychloride), commonly used in organic farming, and Swing Gold® (epoxiconazole and dimoxystrobin), a synthetic fungicide widely used in conventional farming to protect cereal crops. Laboratory experiments were used to assess the survival, biomass loss and avoidance behaviour. No lethal effect was observed following exposure to the copper fungicide for 14 days, even at 5000 mg kg−1 of copper, i.e. 650 times the recommended dose (RD). However, a significant decrease in biomass was observed from 50 mg kg−1 of copper (6.5 times the RD) for A. caliginosa and at 5000 mg kg−1 of copper (650 times the RD) for E. albidus. These sublethal effects suggest that a longer period of exposure would probably have led to lethal effects. The EC50 avoidance for the copper fungicide was estimated to be 51.2 mg kg−1 of copper (6.7 times the RD) for A. caliginosa, and 393 mg kg−1 of copper (51 times the RD) for E. albidus. For the Swing Gold® fungicide, the estimated LC50 was 7.0 10−3 mL kg−1 (6.3 times the RD) for A. caliginosa and 12.7 10−3 mL kg−1 (11.0 times the RD) for E. albidus. No effect on biomass or avoidance was observed at sublethal concentrations of this synthetic fungicide. It was concluded that enchytraeids were less sensitive than earthworms to the two commercial fungicides in terms of mortality, biomass loss and avoidance behaviour. Therefore we discuss the different strategies possibly used by the two Oligochaeta species to cope with the presence of the pesticides were discussed, along with the potential consequences on the soil functions.",

            "abstract": "Ecotoxicological tests with earthworms are widely used and are mandatory for the risk assessment of pesticides prior to registration and commercial use. The current model species for standardized tests is Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei. However, these species are absent from agricultural soils and often less sensitive to pesticides than other earthworm species found in mineral soils. To move towards a better assessment of pesticide effects on non-target organisms, there is a need to perform a posteriori tests using relevant species. The endogeic species Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny, 1826) is representative of cultivated fields in temperate regions and is suggested as a relevant model test species. After providing information on its taxonomy, biology, and ecology, we reviewed current knowledge concerning its sensitivity towards pesticides. Moreover, we highlighted research gaps and promising perspectives. Finally, advice and recommendations are given for the establishment of laboratory cultures and experiments using this soil-dwelling earthworm species.",

Aporrectodea caliginosa s.s. is one of the dominant earthworm species in agroecosystems and a good candidate for ecotoxicological testing. In order to improve knowledge on its life cycle, we performed growth and reproduction experiments. These data were used to calibrate an energy-based model that displayed good descriptions of A. caliginosa life cycle parameters under different feeding conditions (ad libitum, food limitations, or absence of food). Here we showed that the maintenance costs were negligible, resulting in a linear growth in length when food was provided ad libitum (i.e., without any restriction). We also found that the switch from the juvenile to adult stage depended on the individual weight, and that the threshold weight was not influenced by the amount of provided food (horse dung). Moreover, we provided evidence that once adults, if they were not isolated from other individuals, the energy was entirely allocated to cocoon production, which only depended on the available food amount, without any effect of the earthworm density. Finally, we discussed the usefulness of our energybased model to support the set up and analyses of ecotoxicological tests and experiments.",

The General Unified Threshold model for Survival (GUTS) provides a framework for deriving toxicokinetic−toxicodynamic (TKTD) models, which account for effects of toxicant exposure on survival in time. Starting from the classic assumptions of independent action and concentration addition, we derive equations for the GUTS reduced (GUTS-RED) model corresponding to these mixture toxicity concepts and go on to demonstrate their application. Using experimental binary mixture studies with Enchytraeus crypticus and previously published data for Daphnia magna and Apis mellifera, we assessed the predictive power of the extended GUTS-RED framework for mixture assessment. The extended models accurately predicted the mixture effect. The GUTS parameters on single exposure data, mixture model calibration, and predictive power analyses on mixture exposure data offer novel diagnostic tools to inform on the chemical mode of action, specifically whether a similar or dissimilar form of damage is caused by mixture components. Finally, observed deviations from model predictions can identify interactions, e.g., synergism or antagonism, between chemicals in the mixture, which are not accounted for by the models. TKTD models, such as GUTS-RED, thus offer a framework to implement new mechanistic knowledge in mixture hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "The assessment of chemical mixture toxicity is one of the major challenges in ecotoxicology. Chemicals can interact, leading to more or less effects than expected, commonly named synergism and antagonism respectively. The classic ad hoc approach for the assessment of mixture effects is based on dose-response curves at a single time point, and is limited to identifying a mixture interaction but cannot provide predictions for untested exposure durations, nor for scenarios where exposure varies in time. We here propose a new approach using toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modelling: The General Unified Threshold model of Survival (GUTS) framework, recently extended for mixture toxicity assessment. We designed a dedicated mechanistic interaction module coupled with the GUTS mixture model to i) identify interactions, ii) test hypotheses to identify which chemical is likely responsible for the interaction, and finally iii) simulate and predict the effect of synergistic and antagonistic mixtures. We tested the modelling approach experimentally with two species (Enchytraeus crypticus and Mamestra brassicae) exposed to different potentially synergistic mixtures (composed of: prochloraz, imidacloprid, cypermethrin, azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, and chlorpyrifos). Furthermore, we also tested the model with previously published experimental data on two other species (Bombus terrestris and Daphnia magna) exposed to pesticide mixtures (clothianidin, propiconazole, dimethoate, imidacloprid and thiacloprid) found to be synergistic or antagonistic with the classic approach. The results showed an accurate simulation of synergistic and antagonistic effects for the different tested species and mixtures. This modelling approach can identify interactions accounting for the entire time of exposure, and not only at one time point as in the classic approach, and provides predictions of the mixture effect for untested mixture exposure scenarios, including those with time-variable mixture composition.",

            "abstract": "The Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEB) enables ecotoxicologists to model the effects of chemical stressors on organism life cycles through the coupling of toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models. While good progress has been made in the application of DEB-TKTD models for aquatic organisms, applications for soil fauna are scarce, due to the lack of dedicated experimental designs suitable for collecting the required time series effect data. Enchytraeids (Annelida: Clitellata) are model organisms in soil ecology and ecotoxicology. They are rec­ ognised as indicators of biological activity in soil, and chemical stress in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this, the application of DEB-TKTD models to investigate the impact of chemicals has not yet been tested on this family. Here we assessed the impact of the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin on the life cycle of Enchytraeus crypticus. We developed an original experimental design to collect the data required for the calibration of a DEB-TKTD model for this species. E. crypticus presented a slow initial growth phase that has been successfully simulated with the addition of a size-dependent food limitation for juveniles in the DEB model. The DEB-TKTD model simulations successfully agreed with the data for all endpoints and treatments over time. The highlighted physiological mode of action (pMoA) for cypermethrin was an increase of the growth energy cost. The threshold for effects on survival was estimated at 73.14 mg kg− 1, and the threshold for effects on energy budget (i.e., sublethal effects) at 19.21 mg kg− 1. This study demonstrates that DEB-TKTD models can be successfully applied to E. crypticus as a representative soil species, and may improve the ecological risk assessment for terrestrial ecosystems, and our mechanistic understanding of chemical effects on non-target species.",

            "abstract": "1. In an ecological approach to risk assessment, population models may play an important role. Our population dynamical models take into account the complex life history of earthworms, as well as a particular ecological interaction (predation). 2. Sublethal impact of pesticides is quantified at the individual level in terms of impaired vital rates, i.e. growth, maturation and reproduction. A simple model for the energetic relationships underlying these vital rates quantifies toxic stress mechanistically through proportionality constants relating size to energetic costs of maintenance, growth, food intake and production of offspring. 3. Risk is defined at the population level. Risk resulting from chronic exposure relates to reductions in (equilibrium) density, changes in population size- and age-structure, and probability of surpassing an extinction threshold. Risk posed by a single or intermittent application of a highly degradable pesticide is defined in terms of extinction probabilities and recovery times, and related to pesticide decay and initial applied dose. 4. The models are individual-based and complementary. A deterministic partial differential equation model is used to derive equilibrium properties of the system analytically and to investigate the general dynamic behaviour. An individual-by-individual model shows how this behaviour is influenced by demographic and environmental stochasticity. 5. Results obtained for two species, Lumbricus rubellus and L. terrestris, indicate that both are sensitive to pesticides affecting the energy available for individual growth, as opposed to the amount of energy available for reproduction. Retarded growth impedes individuals in reaching adulthood. This juvenile delay regulation translates from individual performance to population demography. 6. Life-history characteristics appear to make L. terrestris more sensitive to toxic stress than L. rubellus, resulting in longer population recovery times. 7. The insights obtained from the models and the way results depend on model assumptions, are discussed, and compared to the little available observational and experimental evidence. Extensions enabling a full ecological risk assessment for pesticide use are identified. Establishing an explicit relationship between ambient concentration and individual performance seems mandatory prior to use of the models as predictive tools.",

            "abstract": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have proven to be successful in integrating and evaluating the influence of age- or gender-dependent changes with respect to the pharmacokinetics of xenobiotics throughout entire lifetimes. Nevertheless, for an effective application of toxicokinetic modelling to chemical risk assessment, a PBPK model has to be detailed enough to include all the multiple tissues that could be targeted by the various xenobiotics present in the environment. For this reason, we developed a PBPK model based on a detailed compartmentalization of the human body and parameterized with new relationships describing the time evolution of physiological and anatomical parameters. To take into account the impact of human variability on the predicted toxicokinetics, we defined probability distributions for key parameters related to the xenobiotics absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The model predictability was evaluated by a direct comparison between computational predictions and experimental data for the internal concentrations of two chemicals (1,3-butadiene and 2,3,7,8tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). A good agreement between predictions and observed data was achieved for different scenarios of exposure (e.g., acute or chronic exposure and different populations). Our results support that the general stochastic PBPK model can be a valuable computational support in the area of chemical risk analysis.",

            "abstract": "Results of published pesticide mixture toxicity experiments conducted with aquatic organisms were compiled and evaluated to assess the accuracy of predictive mixture models. Three types of models were evaluated: Concentration addition (CA), independent action (IA), and simple interaction (SI). The CA model was the most often tested (207 experiments), followed by SI (59) and IA (37). The reviewed experiments are listed in the Supplemental material to provide a resource for future investigators. The predictive accuracy of each model was quantified for each experiment by the model deviation ratio (MDR), which was calculated by dividing the predicted toxicity by the observed toxicity. Eighty-eight percent of all experiments that evaluated the CA model had observed effective concentrations within a factor of 2 of predicted values (MDR values from 0.5–2.0). The median MDR was 1, about 5% of MDRs were less than 0.5, and about 5% were greater than 2, indicating unbiased estimates overall. The predictive accuracy of CA and IA models was influenced, however, by the different modes of action (MOA) of the pesticides. For experiments with pesticides with the same MOA, CA more accurately predicted effective concentrations for more experiments compared to IA, which tended to underpredict toxicity. The IA model was somewhat more accurate than the CA model for most mixtures with different MOAs, but in most cases there were relatively small differences between the models. Additionally, 80% of SI experiments had an MDR value below 2.0 despite a bias towards experiments that are likely to have an interaction. Thus, results indicate that the CA model may be used as a slightly conservative, but broadly applicable model with a relatively small likelihood of underestimating effects due to interactions.",

The majority of mixture studies are conducted to investigate the effect of one compound on the inhibitory action of another. However, since stimulatory responses to low concentrations of chemicals are gaining increased attention and improved statistical models are available to describe this phenomenon of hormesis, scientists are challenged by the question of what will happen in the low concentration range when all or some of the chemicals in a mixture induce hormesis? Can the mixture effects still be predicted and can the size and concentration range of hormesis be predicted? The present study focused on binary mixtures with one or both compounds inducing hormesis and evaluated six data sets of root length of Lactuca sativa L. and areal growth of Lemna minor L., where substantial and reproducible hormetic responses to allelochemicals and herbicides have been found.",

            "abstract": "The effects of the fungicides azoxystrobin (a strobilurin) and epoxiconazole (a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor) on phyllosphere fungi, senescence and yield were studied in winter wheat in field trials free of visible disease and under controlled environmental conditions. In two field trials, treatments with each of the two fungicides prolonged green leaf area retention and increased yield compared with untreated control plots. Azoxystrobin maintained green leaf area for longer than epoxiconazole and, in one trial, treatments with azoxystrobin gave a greater yield response than epoxiconazole. Mycelial growth on leaf surfaces, mainly originating from saprophytic fungi, was reduced by each of the fungicides. Papilla formation and hypersensitive reactions, almost exclusively against infection attempts by Mycosphaerella spp. (most probably M. graminicola), occurred with high frequency in the leaves. These defence reactions presumably incurred a significant energy cost, accelerating plant senescence. Fewer defence reactions were recorded in azoxystrobin-treated leaves than in epoxiconazole-treated and untreated leaves. Inoculation in a glasshouse experiment with the saprophytic fungi Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium macrocarpum accelerated wheat senescence. Control of the saprophytes by azoxystrobin or epoxiconazole treatments caused a delay in the accelerated senescence, but without significant increase in above-ground biomass and yield. Neither fungicide influenced senescence, above-ground biomass or yield in noninoculated wheat plants. In growth chamber experiments azoxystrobin inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth of A. alternata and C. macrocarpum. Epoxiconazole had little inhibitory effect on spore germination, but strongly inhibited mycelial growth of both saprophytes. Both fungicides reduced A. alternata-induced papilla formation in wheat leaves, with epoxiconazole being more effective. Inoculation with either of the two saprophytes did not significantly increase wheat leaf respiration, in contrast to inoculation with the nonhost pathogen Erysiphe graminis f.sp. hordei. Treatment with azoxystrobin did not affect this latter increase in respiration whereas it was reduced by epoxiconazole treatment. It is proposed that the greater inhibition of infection attempts from Mycosphaerella spp. by azoxystrobin, compared with epoxiconazole, may account for the greater yield given by azoxystrobin in field plots.",

            "abstract": "The aims of this study were to determine depuration rates for a range of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) using Chironomus riparius, and to test a concentration-dependency hypothesis for the long-chain perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) for this species. Midge larvae were exposed to field sediments collected downstream of a fluorotelomer plant, and to the same sediment spiked with PFTrDA. Elimination kinetics results indicated complete elimination of all PFASs by chironomids after 42 h. These data were used to develop two PFTrDA bioaccumulation models accounting for chironomid growth and for compound concentration dependency or not. There was much better agreement between observed and simulated data under the concentration-dependency hypothesis than under the alternative one (passive diffusion). The PFTrDA uptake rate derived from the concentration-dependency model equaled 0.013 ± 0.008 goc gww h−1, and the depuration rate 0.032 ± 0.009 h−1.",

            "abstract": "Plant protection products (PPP) are extensively used to protect plants against harmful organisms, but they also have unintended effects on non-target organisms, especially terrestrial invertebrates. The impact of PPP on ecosystem functions provided by these non-target invertebrates remains, however, unclear. The objectives of this article were to review PPP impacts on the ecosystem functions provided by pollinators, predators and parasitoids, and soil organisms, and to identify the factors that aggravate or mitigate PPP effects. The literature highlights that PPP alter several ecosystem functions: provision and maintenance of biodiversity, pollination, biotic interactions and habitat completeness in terrestrial ecosystems, and organic matter and soil structure dynamics. However, there are still a few studies dealing with ecosystem functions, with sometimes contradictory results, and consequences on agricultural provisioning services remain unclear. The model organisms used to assess PPP ecotoxicological effects are still limited, and should be expanded to better cover the wide functional diversity of terrestrial invertebrates. Data are lacking on PPP sublethal, transgenerational, and “cocktail” effects, and on their multitrophic consequences. In empirical assessments, studies on PPP unintended effects should consider agricultural-pedoclimatic contexts because they influence the responses of non-target organisms and associated ecosystem functions to PPP. Modeling might be a promising way to account for the complex interactions among PPP mixtures, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning.",

This discussion paper provides an overview of the field of combined effects in aquatic ecotoxicology and addresses some of the major challenges related to assessment of combined effects in connection with environmental risk assessment (ERA) and regulation. Potentials and obstacles related to different experimental, modelling and predictive ERA approaches are described. On-going ERA guideline and manual developments in Europe aiming to incorporate combined effects of contaminants, the use of different experimental approaches for providing combined effect data, the involvement of biomarkers to characterize Mode of Action and toxicity pathways and efforts to identify relevant risk scenarios related to combined effects are discussed.",

To address these biases, we develop the probability scaling method, which rescales announcement date returns; and the intervention method, which uses returns at intervening events. Perceived value improvements are larger than traditional methods indicate. We cannot reject the hypothesis that bidders on average pay fair prices. Combined bidder-target stock returns are higher for hostile offers, lower for equity offers, and lower for diversifying offers. These effects reflect revelation about bidder stand-alone value, not differences in gains from combination.",

            "abstract": "The conservation of genetic diversity has emerged as one of the central issues in conservation biology. Although researchers in the areas of evolutionary biology, population management, and conservation biology routinely investigate genetic variability in natural populations, only a handful of studies have addressed the effects of chemical contamination on population genetics. Chemical contamination can cause population reduction by the effects of somatic and heritable mutations, as well as non-genetic modes of toxicity. Stochastic processes in small populations, increased mutation load, and the phenomenon of mutational meltdown are compounding factors that cause reduced fitness and accelerate the process of population extirpation. Although the original damage caused by chemical contaminants is at the molecular level, there are emergent effects at the level of populations, such as the loss of genetic diversity, that are not predictable based solely on knowledge of the mechanism of toxicity of the chemical contaminants. Therefore, the study of evolutionary toxicology, which encompasses the population-genetic effects of environmental contaminants, should be an important focus of ecotoxicology. This paper reviews the issues surrounding the genetic effects of pollution, summarizes the technical approaches that can be used to address these issues, and provides examples of studies that have addressed some of them. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

            "abstract": "The zebrafish embryo test has been discussed as an alternative test system to provide data on acute fish toxicity required by diverse regulations. A meta-analysis of zebrafish embryo acute toxicity (ZFET) data has revealed conflicting evidence that narcotic compounds (i.e. compounds with baseline toxicity) may exhibit weaker sensitivity in the ZFET if compared to the acute (adult) fish toxicity test (AFT). Therefore, six compounds with presumably narcotic or unknown mode of action, and for which a previous meta-analysis has indicated weaker sensitivity were experimentally analyzed for their fish embryo acute toxicity and exposure concentrations were monitored. The data indicated that ZFET and AFT for the selected compounds revealed similar sensitivity and differences were in the range of species differences of the AFT.",

            "abstract": "Biodiversity is responsible for the provision of many ecosystem services; human well-being is based on these services, and consequently on biodiversity. In soil, earthworms represent the largest component of the animal biomass and are commonly termed “ecosystem engineers”. This review considers the contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services through pedogenesis, development of soil structure, water regulation, nutrient cycling, primary production, climate regulation, pollution remediation and cultural services. Although there has been much research into the role of earthworms in soil ecology, this review demonstrates substantial gaps in our knowledge related in particular to difficulties in identifying the effects of species, land use and climate. The review aims to assist people involved in all aspects of land management, including conservation, agriculture, mining or other industries, to obtain a broad knowledge of earthworms and ecosystem services.",

            "abstract": "Mechanistic representations of individual life-history trajectories are powerful tools for the prediction of organismal growth, reproduction and survival under novel environmental conditions. Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides compact models to describe the acquisition and allocation of energy by organisms over their full life cycle. However, estimating DEB model parameters, and their associated uncertainties and covariances, is not trivial. Bayesian inference provides a coherent way to estimate parameter uncertainty, and propagate it through the model, while also making use of prior information to constrain the parameter space. We outline a Bayesian inference approach for energy budget models and provide two case studies – based on a simplified DEBkiss model, and the standard DEB model – detailing the implementation of such inference procedures using the opensource software package deBInfer. We demonstrate how DEB and DEBkiss parameters can be estimated in a Bayesian framework, but our results also highlight the difficulty of identifying DEB model parameters which serves as a reminder that fitting these models requires statistical caution.",

            "abstract": "Natural populations consist of phenotypically diverse individuals that exhibit variation in their demographic parameters and intra- and inter-specific interactions. Recent experimental work indicates that such variation can have significant ecological effects. However, ecological models typically disregard this variation and focus instead on trait means and total population density. Under what situations is this simplification appropriate? Why might intraspecific variation alter ecological dynamics? In this review we synthesize recent theory and identify six general mechanisms by which trait variation changes the outcome of ecological interactions. These mechanisms include several direct effects of trait variation per se and indirect effects arising from the role of genetic variation in trait evolution.",

            "abstract": "This review considers potential approaches to solve an important problem concerning the impact of applied pesticides of various classes on living organisms, mainly agricultural crops used as food. We used the method of multi-residual determination of several pesticides in agricultural food products with its practical application for estimating pesticides in real products and in model experiments. The distribution of the pesticide between the components of the soil-plant system was studied with a pesticide of the sulfonylureas class, i.e., rimsulfuron. Autoradiography showed that rimsulfuron inhibits the development of plants considered as weeds. Cereals are less susceptible to the effects of pesticides such as acetamiprid, flumetsulam and florasulam, while the development of legume shoots was inhibited with subsequent plant death.",

These criteria reflect the consensus of the literature on interaction analysis developed over decades of research in pharmacology, toxicology, and biometry; address common pitfalls in published interaction studies; and can be easily applied to common methods of interaction analysis. The criteria apply broadly to interaction data for drugs, pesticides, industrial chemicals, food additives, and natural products and are intended to assist risk assessors who must evaluate interaction studies for use in component-based mixture risk assessments. The criteria may also assist researchers interested in conducting interaction studies to inform mixture risk assessment. The criteria are also intended to serve larger scientific goals, including increasing the repeatability of results obtained in chemical interaction studies, enhancing the reliability of conclusions drawn from interaction data, providing greater consistency of interpretations among various analysts, and decreasing uncertainty in using interaction data in risk assessments. We describe the basis for each criterion and demonstrate their utility by using them to evaluate interaction studies from the recent toxicological and pharmacological literature, which serve as examples of different types of data sets that the risk assessor may encounter.",

            "abstract": "Biochar usage in agriculture becomes increasingly important for the improvement of soil properties. However, from the perspective of pesticides, biochar can influence exposure to pesticides of both target and non-target organisms and also pesticides’ fate in soil. Our study investigated degradation and bioaccumulation (in the Eisenia andrei earthworm) of two conazole fungicides, epoxiconazole and tebuconazole, added to high- and low-sorbing soils (by means of fungicides’ sorption measured beforehand) amended with low-, moderate- and high-sorbing biochars at 0.2% and 2% doses. We aimed to investigate the effects of contrasting soil and biochar properties, different doses of biochar in soil-biochar mixtures, and different compounds on the degradation and bioaccumulation. We also wanted to explore if the beforehand determined sorption of fungicides on individual soils and biochars is manifested somehow in their degradation and/or bioaccumulation in soil-biochar mixtures. The biochars’ presence in the soils promoted the degradation of fungicides with a clear effect of dose and soil, but less clear effect of biochar or compound. The bioaccumulation factors were higher in low-sorbing soil variants and also decreased with increasing biochar dose. For low-sorbing soil variants, the bioaccumulation was also influenced by the type of biochar corresponding to its sorbing potential and the possible effect on the bioavailability of the fungicides. Our results show that mixing of biochars with soils changes the fate and bioaccumulation of the conazole fungicides. However, the sorption results from original materials are not straightforwardly manifested in the more complex soil-biota system.",

            "abstract": "Numerous threats affect aquatic ecosystems at different biological organizational levels from individuals to ecosystems. Stresses occurring on the metabolism and physiological functions of individuals can have repercussions on the individual behavior, its ability to survive and reproduce, also known as the individual fitness, which may then influence the demography and spatial distribution of populations, and ultimately modify trophic flows and ecosystem functioning. In a context of a globally changing environment, predicting the life history traits and fitness of individuals can be relevantly performed with the association of laboratory experiments with Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, while modeling species interactions have proven to be an efficient tool to understand aquatic food webs using mass-balanced models such as linear inverse models (LIMs) or Chance and Necessity (CaN) models. However, while predictive results obtained on individuals can be provided with a thorough mechanistic interpretation, the propagation of the effects is most often limited to the closest biological hierarchical level, i.e., the population, and rarely to the food-web level. Furthermore, there is a need to understand how to avoid misleading approaches and interpretations due to the simplicity of experiments. For the moment, no clear methodology has stood out yet to do so. In this study, we provide a new methodology based on a combination of models (i.e., DEB, LIM, and CaN) aiming at upscaling information from laboratory experiments on individuals to ecosystems to address multiple ecological issues. This framework has a potential to enhance our understanding of higher-scale consequences of the effect of stressors measured at the sub-individual scale. This combination of models was chosen for the convergence of their framework but also their ability to consider a substantial portion of the projected uncertainty. The description of this methodology can help experimenters and modelers to jointly address a specific question involving upscaling from individual to ecosystem, proposes approaches, and gives tips on the pitfalls to avoid along the upscaling process.",

            "abstract": "The present monitoring and assessment of the chemical status of water bodies fail to characterize the likelihood that complex mixtures of chemicals affect water quality. The European Collaborative Project SOLUTIONS suggests that this likelihood can be estimated with effect-based methods (EBMs) complemented by chemical screening and/or impact modeling. These methods should be used to identify the causes of impacted water quality and to develop programs of measures to improve water quality. Along this line of reasoning, effect-based methods are recommended for Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring to cover the major modes of action in the universe of environmentally relevant chemicals so as to evaluate improvements of water quality upon implementing the measures. To this end, a minimum battery of bioassays has been recommended including short-term toxicity to algae, Daphnia and fish embryos complemented with in vitro and short-term in vivo tests on mode-of-action specific effects as proxies for long-term toxicity. The likelihood of adverse impacts can be established with effect-based trigger values, which differ‑entiate good from poor water quality in close alignment with Environmental Quality Standards for individual chemi‑cals, while taking into account mixture toxicity. The use of EBMs is suggested in the WFD as one avenue to establish the likelihood of adverse effects due to chemical pollution in European water systems. The present paper has been written as one component of a series of policy briefs to support decisions on water quality monitoring and manage‑ment under the WFD.",

            "abstract": "The present work describes the development and validation of a reference method conducted at the French National Institute of Metrology (LNE) for the quantitative determination of psychoactive compounds in the dissolved fraction of surface waters. More specifically an isotope dilution-SPE-LC–MS/MS based method has been implemented for the characterization of a broad range of analytes belonging to different classes of psychotropic drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, stimulants, opiates and opioids, anticonvulsants, anti-dementia drugs, analgesics as well as the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac in the low ng LÀ1 range of concentration. Full validation of the method was performed following procedures described by the French standard NF T90-210. Limits of quantification between 0.14 and 3.54 ng LÀ1 were obtained. Method recoveries from 71 to 123% were observed with standard deviation below 10% in intermediate precision conditions. Accuracy was determined for every compound: measurement errors were between À 4 and þ1% and standard deviations in intermediate precision conditions were included within a 1–9% interval. Finally, measurement uncertainties were evaluated following the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM). Expanded uncertainties (k ¼2) ranged from 2% for carbamazepine, EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) and venlafaxine to 17% for diazepam. The validated method was implemented to Seine river surface waters demonstrating its fitness for purpose. All compounds were detected and 22 out of 25 analytes were quantified. More specifically, measured concentration ranged from 0.39 ng LÀ1 for MDMA (3,4-methylene-dioxy-Nmethylamphetamine) to 182 ng LÀ1 for gabapentine.",

            "abstract": "Unintended Recipients of Antidepressants Pharmaceuticals are used to treat a wide variety of ailments and conditions in humans. However, many animal species share physiologies, receptors, and pathways that may be acted upon by pharmaceutical compounds. Increasingly, pharmaceuticals are being found in natural aquatic systems. Such pharmaceutical pollution can cause mortality and alter development and reproduction of aquatic animals. Brodin et al. (p. 814 ) report that excreted drugs may also have far more subtle, yet eventually significant, impacts in natural systems. Benzodiazepines, which reduce anxiety in humans, alter social and foraging behavior in fish. European perch exposed to oxazepam were bolder, more active, less social and fed more rapidly. , Anxiolytic drugs, at concentrations found in natural waterways, alter the behavior and foraging rate of wild European perch. , Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals is increasingly recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. A variety of pharmaceuticals enter waterways by way of treated wastewater effluents and remain biochemically active in aquatic systems. Several ecotoxicological studies have been done, but generally, little is known about the ecological effects of pharmaceuticals. Here we show that a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) alters behavior and feeding rate of wild European perch ( Perca fluviatilis ) at concentrations encountered in effluent-influenced surface waters. Individuals exposed to water with dilute drug concentrations (1.8 micrograms liter –1 ) exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. As such, our results show that anxiolytic drugs in surface waters alter animal behaviors that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences.",

            "abstract": "Count data can be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models when observations are correlated in ways that require random effects. However, count data are often zero-inflated, containing more zeros than would be expected from the typical error distributions. We present a new package, glmmTMB, and compare it to other R packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models. The glmmTMB package fits many types of GLMMs and extensions, including models with continuously distributed responses, but here we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB, MCMCglmm, and brms, and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One unique feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean. Overall, its most appealing features for new users may be the combination of speed, flexibility, and its interface’s similarity to lme4.",

This is done from a knowledge of the concentrations of these poisons and of the temperature, pH value, total hardness, bicarbonate alkalinity, total dissolved solids concentration, and dissolved-oxygen concentration of the dilution water. The toxicity of the mixture is taken to be the sum of the proportions of the acutely toxic concentration of each poison. The assumptions made in the use of this method are discussed along with its limitations, and the fact that in critical areas of study, such estimates can never he substitutes for the actual determination of the toxicity of a water by the use of fish is stressed.",

            "abstract": "Exposure to environmental chemicals can have negative consequences for wildlife and even cause localized population extinctions. Resistance to chemical stress, however, can evolve and the mechanisms include desensitized target sites, reduced chemical uptake and increased metabolic detoxification and sequestration. Chemical resistance in wildlife populations can also arise independently of exposure and may be spread by gene flow between populations. Inbreeding—matings between closely related individuals—can have negative fitness consequences for natural populations, and there is evidence of inbreeding depression in many wildlife populations. In some cases, reduced fitness in inbred populations has been shown to be exacerbated under chemical stress. In chemical testing, both inbred and outbred laboratory animals are used and for human safety assessments, iso-genic strains (virtual clones) of mice and rats are often employed that reduce response variation, the number of animals used and associated costs. In contrast, for environmental risk assessment, strains of animals are often used that have been selectively bred to maintain heterozygosity, with the assumption that they are better able to predict adverse effects in wild, genetically variable, animals. This may not necessarily be the case however, as one outbred strain may not be representative of another or of a wild population. In this paper, we critically discuss relationships between genetic variation, inbreeding and chemical effects with the intention of seeking to support more effective chemical testing for the protection of wildlife.",

            "abstract": "Before plant protection product (PPP) marketing authorization, a risk assessment for nontarget soil organisms (e.g., earthworms) is required as part of Regulation (EC) No. 1107/2009. Following a stepwise approach, higher tier earthworm field studies are needed if they cannot demonstrate low long‐term risk based on laboratory studies. The European guidance for terrestrial ecotoxicology refers to ISO guideline 11268‐3 as a standard to conduct earthworm field studies. Assessment of such studies may be challenging, as no European harmonized guidance is available to properly analyze the accuracy, representativeness, and appropriateness of experimental designs, as well as the statistical analysis robustness of results and their scientific reliability. Following the ISO guideline 11268‐3, a field study was performed in 2016–2017 (Versailles, France). An assessment of the first year of this field study was performed in agreement with the quality criteria provided in 2006 in the guidance document published by de Jong and collaborators and recommendations by Kula and collaborators that allows describing the protocol and results of earthworm field studies. Not only did we underline the importance of a detailed analysis of raw data on the effects of pesticides on earthworms in field situations, but we also provided recommendations to harmonize protocols for assessing higher tier field studies devoted to earthworms to advance a better assessment of PPP fate and ecotoxicity. In particular, we provided practical field observations related to the study design, pesticide applications, and earthworm sampling. Concurrently, in addition to the conventional earthworm community study, we propose carrying out an assessment of soil function (i.e., organic matter decomposition, soil structuration, etc.) and calculating diversity indices to obtain information about earthworm community dynamics after the application of PPPs. Finally, through field observations, any relevant observation of external and/or internal recovery should be reported. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2023;19:254–271. © 2022 The Authors.

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.",

            "abstract": "Controlled experiments were conducted to assess the effects of earthworm interactions in paired species groupings in comparison to monocultures. Species examined included Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea longa, Dendrobaena veneta, Lumbricus rubellus, Lumbricus terrestris and Octolasion cyaneum. One experiment examined growth rates using hatchling worms in 600 ml pots of loamy soil and a feed of separated cattle solids (SCS). The culture medium was also wet-sieved for cocoons when worms matured. A second experiment employed mature A. longa, L. terrestris and O. cyaneum in 2 l containers. Treatments here examined intra- and inter-speci®c interactions assessed in terms of mass change and cocoon production. Mean masses obtained in single species cultures were greater than those from mixed pairings over the same time period. The former also attained a reproductive state more rapidly. D. veneta had the most signi®cant negative effect on other species under the given conditions. Experiment 2 suggested that both intra- and inter-speci®c competition can affect A. longa, the latter being greater with L. terrestris. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms perform many ecosystem services. However, due to their body shape, mucus covering, and subterranean behaviour, it has been very difficult to successfully tag individual animals for experimental purposes. This paper examines the potential use of commercially available visible implant elastomer (VIE) tags to mark earthworms. Two laboratory experiments were conducted employing four temperate earthworm species by injection of the VIE and making regular assessments. Results showed that the biologically compatible polymer tags, injected into earthworm muscle, remained in the animal and could be visually located after a period of 12 months. Tagging did not affect growth to maturity, mating or cocoon production of Lumbricus terrestris. VIE tagging can now be viewed as a viable technique for marking this and other earthworm species.",

            "abstract": "Consistent between-individual differences in movement are widely recognised across taxa. In addition, foraging plasticity at the within-individual level suggests a behavioural dependency on the internal energy demand. Because behaviour co-varies with fast-slow life history (LH) strategies in an adaptive context, as theoretically predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, mass/energy fluxes should link behaviour and its plasticity with physiology at both between- and withinindividual levels. However, a mechanistic framework driving these links in a fluctuating ecological context is lacking. Focusing on home range behaviour, we propose a novel behavioural-bioenergetics theoretical model to address such complexities at the individual level based on energy balance. We propose explicit mechanistic links between behaviour, physiology/metabolism and LH by merging two well-founded theories, the movement ecology paradigm and the dynamic energetic budget theory. Overall, our behavioural-bioenergetics model integrates the mechanisms explaining how (1) behavioural between- and within-individual variabilities connect with internal state variable dynamics, (2) physiology and behaviour are explicitly interconnected by mass/energy fluxes, and (3) different LHs may arise from both behavioural and physiological variabilities in a given ecological context. Our novel theoretical model reveals encouraging opportunities for empiricists and theoreticians to delve into the eco-evolutionary processes that favour or hinder the development of between-individual differences in behaviour and the evolution of personality-dependent movement syndromes.",

            "abstract": "Les micropolluants (MP) représentent un enjeu environnemental et sanitaire important. Identifier leurs sources pour ensuite réduire leurs rejets est la stratégie privilégiée au niveau français pour lutter contre cette pollution. C’est aussi la démarche qui a été mise en oeuvre dans le projet Regard (réduction et gestion des micropolluants sur la métropole bordelaise). La première phase du projet correspondait ainsi à la réalisation d’un diagnostic territorial, global et intégré couplant à la fois des analyses chimiques et biologiques du milieu naturel et du réseau d’assainissement depuis les points de rejets (station de traitement des eaux usées, exutoires pluviaux, by-pass) jusqu’aux sources d’émission (domestique, industrielle, hospitalière et pluviale). En complément, une caractérisation sociale des sources a été faite afin de comprendre les pratiques, les produits et les usages à l’origine des rejets de MP et d’identifier des leviers d’action pour réduire ces rejets. Les points forts de ce diagnostic sont la complémentarité des approches (sciences de l’ingénieur et sciences sociales, analyses chimiques et biologiques, étude des eaux usées et pluviales) et le nombre important de sites d’étude. La seconde phase du projet correspondait à la mise en oeuvre d’actions de réduction pour les tester et les évaluer du point de vue environnemental (efficacité pour réduire la quantité, la diversité et l’effet des MP), social (appropriation et satisfaction vis-à-vis des solutions) et économique (aide à l’orientation de l’action publique). Les actions ayant eu les meilleurs résultats sont (i) l’action « Familles EAU Défi » sur la source domestique, (ii) les actions de dératisation mécanique, de démoussage des terrains de tennis et d’enherbement des cimetières pour la source collectivité et (iii) l’action de traitement des eaux pluviales strictes en conditions réelles à l’échelle d’un pilote. Le présent retour d’expérience sur ce qui a été fait doit aider les collectivités qui souhaiteraient effectuer une telle démarche à ne pas commettre les mêmes « erreurs » et, au contraire, à mettre en oeuvre directement les actions qui donnent des résultats satisfaisants.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms have been termed “ecosystem engineers” (sensu [Jones, C.G., Lawton, J.H., Shachak, M., 1994. Organisms as ecosysem engineers. Oikos 69, 373–386.]) because of the important roles they play in the soil. As a consequence, it is assumed that if earthworms change their behaviour following exposure to pesticides or pollutants this could have a drastic impact on soil functioning. To test this assumption under laboratory conditions, we studied the burrow systems made by two earthworm species (the anecic Aporrectodea nocturna and the endogeic Allolobophora icterica) in artificial soil cores containing imidacloprid, a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide. After 1-month incubation period, the macropores created in the soil core were analyzed by tomography. In order to further characterize transfer properties associated with burrow systems gas diffusion measurements were also carried out. The burrow systems made by the two earthworm species were very different: A. nocturna made more continuous, less branched, more vertical and wider burrows than A. icterica. Some changes to A. nocturna burrow systems were observed after exposure to imidacloprid (they made a smaller burrow system and burrows were more narrow), but only at the highest concentration of imidacloprid used (0.5 mg kgK1). A. icterica worms were more sensitive to imidacloprid and many differences in their burrow systems (length, sinuosity, branching rate and number of burrows) were observed at both concentrations tested (0.1 and 0. 5 mg kgK1). As a consequence, the continuity of the burrow systems made by both species was altered following imidacloprid treatment. Gas diffusion through the A. nocturna soil cores was reduced but no difference in gas diffusion was observed in the A. icterica soil cores.",

            "abstract": "The three main ecological categories of earthworms (anecic, endogeic, epigeic) are often used as proxies for functional groups. This is troublesome since they were not designed for this purpose and thus the relevance of such a use was never tested nor proven. How earthworms influence the different soil functions is tightly linked to their bioturbating behavior and thus they are considered as physical ecosystem engineers. Here, we characterized the different facets of this behavior (burrow creation, production of casts below and above ground, and litter consumption) for 50 species or subspecies of European earthworms under standardized laboratory conditions. Using PCA and K-means methods, we defined six new functional groups of earthworms, i.e. intense tunnelers, burrowers, shallow bioturbators, deep bioturbators, litter dwellers and intermediates. Intense tunnelers and burrowers build continuous and vertically oriented burrows, the first however burrow more and consume less litter. Deep bioturbators live deeply in the soil, make very discontinuous burrows and consume no litter. They could be seen as a novel group but they can be linked to the hypo-endogeics ecological categories defined 50 years ago. Litter-dwellers and shallow bioturbators can be respectively linked to the epidegeics and endogeics ecological categories. However, the new groups only partially overlap with the traditional ecological categories. We assume that their use, based on quantitative behavioral assessments, will improve the study of the re­ lationships between earthworm communities and the associated provision of ecosystem services by minimizing the overlooked variability within the three main ecological categories regarding their behavior.",

The intestinal microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms and their genes and encoded functions that colonize the host gastrointestinal tract. There is growing interest in understanding the mechanisms by which microbiota interact with xenobiotics to affect host toxicity outcomes. This review will focus on exploring recent evidence that supports interactions between xenobiotics and host-associated microbes, specifically in the zebrafish model. The benefits and shortcomings of the zebrafish model in the context of chemical-microbiome interactions and major knowledge gaps will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Fungicides inhibiting the biosynthesis of ergostrol, such as the triazoles and imidazoles, have been shown to enhance the effect of insecticides on birds, mammals and invertebrates in the terrestrial environment. The synergy is proposed to be due to an effect on P450 monooxygenase enzymes active in pesticide metabolism in these organisms. Fungicides often enter the aquatic environment jointly with other pesticides. It is therefore possible that they could act as synergists also in the aquatic environment. In this study we tested the joint effect of the imidazole fungicide prochloraz together with the herbicides acifluorfen, diquat and terbuthylazine, the fungicide azoxystrobin and the insecticides chlorfenvinphos, dimethoate, and pirimicarb on the bacteria Vibrio fischeri (six binary mixtures), the crustacean Daphnia magna (four binary mixtures), the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (four binary mixtures) and the floating plant Lemna minor (three binary mixtures). All the binary mixtures were evaluated both in relation to the model of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) using isobolograms. The study showed strong synergy in relation to CA between prochloraz and azoxystrobin, diquat and esfenvalerat on D. magna with sums of toxic units for the 50:50% effect mixture ( TU50:50) as low as 0.25. The mixture with dimethoate was however antagonistic with TU50:50 of 2.04. Four out of the six mixtures testes on V. fisheri showed synergy in relation to CA, but for three of the mixtures the response could be explained by IA. Only the mixture with diquat showed synergy in relation to both IA and CA with TU50:50 around 0.50. There was no significant synergy for any of the combinations tested on the plant and the algae species in relation to CA and only for diquat in the algae-test in relation to IA. Hence, prochloraz does synergise the effect of some pesticides in the aquatic environment, but not consistently across species. The organism most susceptible to synergy by prochloraz in this study was D. magna. Especially the combination with insecticides such as esfenvalerate, where the concentration needed to immobilize 50% of the daphnia was reduced from $>$3 ␮g L−1 to less than 0.5 ␮g L−1 when prochloraz was added, could be problematic as these concentrations are environmentally realistic. Furthermore, insecticides and ergostrol-biosynthesis-inhibitors (EBIfungicides) are often applied together, and are therefore likely to co-exist in surface waters, enhancing the problem of the already very potent insecticides.",

The results can be interpreted in relation to reference models by the use of response-surface analyses and isobolograms. The amount of data needed for these analyses is, however, extensive, and the experiments therefore rarely are repeated. In the present study, we investigate the reproducibility of isobole shapes of binary-mixture toxicity experiments in terms of deviation from the reference model of concentration addition (CA), dose-level dependence, and isobole asymmetry. We use data from four herbicide mixtures tested in three to five independent experiments on the aquatic test plant Lemna minor and the terrestrial plant Tripleurospermum inodorum. The results showed that the variation both within and among experiments was approximately half the size for the aquatic test system compared to the terrestrial system. As a consequence, a consistent deviation from CA could be obtained in three of four herbicide mixtures for L. minor, whereas this was only the case for one or two of the herbicide mixtures tested on T. inodorum. For one mixture on T. inodorum, both CA synergism and antagonism were detected. Dose-dependent effects could not be repeated consistently, just as the asymmetry found in some isoboles could not. The study emphasizes the importance of repeating mixture toxicity experiments, especially for test systems with large variability, and using caution when drawing biological conclusions from the test results.",

            "abstract": "Binary-mixture studies often are conducted with the aim of elucidating the effect of one specific chemical on the biological action of another. The results can be interpreted in relation to reference models by the use of response-surface analyses and isobolograms. The amount of data needed for these analyses is, however, extensive, and the experiments therefore rarely are repeated. In the present study, we investigate the reproducibility of isobole shapes of binary-mixture toxicity experiments in terms of deviation from the reference model of concentration addition (CA), dose-level dependence, and isobole asymmetry. We use data from four herbicide mixtures tested in three to five independent experiments on the aquatic test plant Lemna minor and the terrestrial plant Tripleurospermum inodorum. The results showed that the variation both within and among experiments was approximately half the size for the aquatic test system compared to the terrestrial system. As a consequence, a consistent deviation from CA could be obtained in three of four herbicide mixtures for L. minor, whereas this was only the case for one or two of the herbicide mixtures tested on T. inodorum. For one mixture on T. inodorum, both CA synergism and antagonism were detected. Dose-dependent effects could not be repeated consistently, just as the asymmetry found in some isoboles could not. The study emphasizes the importance of repeating mixture toxicity experiments, especially for test systems with large variability, and using caution when drawing biological conclusions from the test results.",

            "abstract": "From a theoretical point of view, it has often been argued that the model of independent action (IA) is the most correct reference model to use for predicting the joint effect of mixtures of chemicals with different molecular target sites. The theory of IA, however, relies on a number of assumptions that are rarely fulfilled in practice. It has even been argued that, theoretically, the concentration addition (CA) model could be just as correct. In the present study, we tested the accuracy of both IA and CA in describing binary dose-response surfaces of chemicals with different molecular targets using statistical software. We compared the two models to determine which best describes data for 158 data sets. The data sets represented 98 different mixtures of, primarily, pesticides and pharmaceuticals tested on one or several of seven test systems containing one of the following: Vibrio fischeri, activated sludge microorganisms, Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Lemna minor, Tripleurospermum inodorum, or Stellaria media. The analyses showed that approximately 20% of the mixtures were adequately predicted only by IA, 10% were adequately predicted only by CA, and both models could predict the outcome of another 20% of the experiment. Half of the experiments could not be correctly described with either of the two models. When quantifying the maximal difference between modeled synergy or antagonism and the reference model predictions at a 50% effect concentration, neither of the models proved significantly better than the other. Thus, neither model can be selected over the other on the basis of accuracy alone.",

            "abstract": "Cocktail effects and synergistic interactions of chemicals in mixtures are an area of great concern to both the public and regulatory authorities. The main concern is whether some chemicals can enhance the effect of other chemicals, so that they jointly exert a larger effect than predicted. This phenomenon is called synergy. Here we present a review of the scientific literature on three main groups of environmentally relevant chemical toxicants: pesticides, metal ions and antifouling compounds. The aim of the review is to determine 1) the frequency of synergy, 2) the extent of synergy, 3) whether any particular groups or classes of chemicals tend to induce synergy, and 4) which physiological mechanisms might be responsible for this synergy. Synergy is here defined as mixtures with minimum two-fold difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations using Concentration Addition (CA) as a reference model and including both lethal and sublethal endpoints. The results showed that synergy occurred in 7%, 3% and 26% of the 194, 21 and 136 binary pesticide, metal and antifoulants mixtures included in the data compilation on frequency. The difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations was rarely more than 10-fold. For pesticides, synergistic mixtures included cholinesterase inhibitors or azole fungicides in 95% of 69 described cases. Both groups of pesticides are known to interfere with metabolic degradation of other xenobiotics. For the four synergistic metal and 47 synergistic antifoulant mixtures the pattern in terms of chemical groups inducing synergy was less clear. Hypotheses in terms of mechanisms governing these interactions are discussed. It was concluded that true synergistic interactions between chemicals are rare and often occur at high concentrations. Addressing the cumulative rather than synergistic effect of co-occurring chemicals, using standard models as CA, is therefore regarded as the most important step in the risk assessment of chemical cocktails.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the maintenance of individual differences in behavior and physiology is a fundamental goal in ecology and evolution. The pace-­of-­life syndrome hypothesis is often invoked to explain the maintenance of such within-­population variation. This hypothesis predicts that behavioral traits are part of a suite of correlated traits that collectively determine an individual’s propensity to prioritize reproduction or survival. A key assumption of this hypothesis is that these traits are underpinned by genetic trade-­offs among life-­history traits: genetic variants that increase fertility, reproduction and growth might also reduce lifespan. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-­analysis to summarize the evidence for the existence of genetic trade-­offs between five key life-­history traits: survival, growth rate, body size, maturation rate, and fertility. Counter to our predictions, we found an overall positive genetic correlation between survival and other life-­history traits and no evidence for any genetic correlations between the non-­survival life-­history traits. This finding was generally consistent across pairs of life-­history traits, sexes, life stages, lab vs. field studies, and narrow-­vs. broad-­sense correlation estimates. Our study highlights that genetic trade-­offs may not be as common, or at least not as easily quantifiable, in animals as often assumed.",

            "abstract": "Sublethal dosages of imidacloprid cause long-term destructive effects on honey bees at the individual and colony levels. In this review, the molecular effects of sublethal imidacloprid were integrated and reported. Several general effects have been observed among different reports using different approaches. Quantitative PCR approaches revealed that imidacloprid treatments during the adult stage are expressed as changes in immuneresponse, detoxification, and oxidation-reduction response in both workers and queens. In addition, transcriptomic approaches suggested that phototransduction, behavior, and somatic muscle development also were affected. Although worker larvae show a higher tolerance to imidacloprid than adults, molecular evidence reveals its potential impacts. Sublethal imidacloprid treatment during the larval stage causes gene expression changes in larvae, pupae, and adults. Transcriptome profiles suggest that the population and functions of affected differentially expressed genes, DEGs, vary among different worker ages. Furthermore, an early transcriptomic switch from nurse bees to foragers was observed, suggesting that precocious foraging activity may occur. This report comprehensively describes the molecular effects of sublethal dosages of imidacloprid on the honey bee Apis mellifera. The corresponding molecular pathways for physiological and neurological responses in imidacloprid-exposed honey bees were validated. Transcriptomic evidence suggests a global and sustained sublethal impact of imidacloprid on honey bee development.",

            "abstract": "Developing zebrafish are increasingly being used for rapid assessments of chemical toxicity, and these assays are frequently conducted in multi-well plastic plates. This study investigated the sorptive behavior of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) to uncoated 96-well polystyrene plates typically used for zebrafish (Danio rerio) testing. We measured the percent sorption in the presence and absence of zebrafish embryos, at two exposure concentrations, as well as using two different procedures (addition of embryos to polystyrene plates either before analyte addition, or allowing 24 h of equilibrium between analyte addition and embryo addition to the polystyrene plates). Following exposure, the plates were extracted with hexane and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Allowing 24 h of preincubation between the addition of analytes and embryos did not significantly impact the percent sorption. The percent sorption was higher for both PAHs and NPAHs at the lower exposure concentration, and sorption was lower in the presence of zebrafish embryos. A mass balance model was developed to predict the sorption to polystyrene plates, based on the PAH and NPAH mass distribution ratios between polystyrene and water. While PAH sorption was significantly correlated with subcooled liquid solubility, NPAH sorption did not correlate with any of the physical-chemical properties investigated. This indicates the need to better understand the sorptive behavior of hydrophobic analytes to plastics, and to better account for sorptive losses during toxicity testing in polystyrene plates.",

            "abstract": "To evaluate the ecotoxicological potential of ten prescription drugs against aquatic organisms from different taxonornical classes, a set of biotests were performed using the cladoceran Daphnia magna , the chlorophyte Desmodesmus subspicatus and the macrophyte Lemna minor . Endpoints were immobilisation for Daphnia and inhibition of the average growth rate for Desmodesmus and Lemna . For most of the substances, toxicities were moderate, with EC50s in the range from 10 to 100 mg l(1 or even far above, whereas Lemna was the most sensitive test species in the majority of all tested compounds. Tests with combinations of various pharmaceuticals revealed stronger effects than expected from the effects measured singly. Clofibrinic acid and Carbamazepine have been found to act by a non-specific mode of action (non-polar narcosis), and with Daphnia the combination effect of these substances followed the concept of concentration addition, while in the algae test the concept of independent action could be used to calculate the mixture toxicity. The anti-inflammatory drugs Diclofenac and Ibuprofen have also been found to act unspecific by non-polar narcosis and to follow the concept of concentration addition in the algal test as well as in the Daphnia test. The measured toxicities of the tested pharmaceuticals shows that acute effect of single substances in the aquatic environment are very unlikely. But we should keep in mind that considerable combination effects can occur and that toxicity data from chronic studies are needed to assess the environmental risk of drug residues.",

            "abstract": "The accessibility of new genomic resources, high-throughput molecular technologies and analytical approaches such as genome scans have made finding genes contributing to fitness variation in natural populations an increasingly feasible task. Once candidate genes are identified, we argue that it is necessary to take a mechanistic approach and work up through the levels of biological organization to fully understand the impacts of genetic variation at these candidate genes. We demonstrate how this approach provides testable hypotheses about the causal links among levels of biological organization, and assists in designing relevant experiments to test the effects of genetic variation on phenotype, whole-organism performance capabilities and fitness. We review some of the research programs that have incorporated mechanistic approaches when examining naturally occurring genetic and phenotypic variation and use these examples to highlight the value of developing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between genotype and fitness. We give suggestions to guide future research aimed at uncovering and understanding the genetic basis of adaptation and argue that further integration of mechanistic approaches will help molecular ecologists better understand the evolution of natural populations.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural intensification, and in particular the use of pesticides, leads over the years to a loss of biodiversity and a decline of ecosystem services in cultivated zones and agricultural landscapes. Among the animal communities involved in the functioning of agro-ecosystems, earthworms are ubiquitous and recognized as indicators of land uses and cultural practices. However, little data is available on the levels of pesticides in such organisms in natura, which would allow estimating their actual exposure and the potentially resulting impacts. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a sensitive analytical methodology to detect and quantify 27 currently used pesticides in earthworms (Allolobophora chlorotica). A modified QuEChERS extraction was implemented on individual earthworms. This step was followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). The whole analytical method was validated on spiked earthworm blank samples, with regard to linearity (from 1 to 100 method limit of quantification, r2 $>$ 0.95), intra-day precision (relative standard deviation (RSD) $<$ 15%), inter-day precision (RSD $<$ 20%), recoveries (mainly in the range 70–110%), and limits of detection and of quantification (inferior to 5 ng/g for most of the pesticides). The developed method was successfully applied to determine the concentrations of pesticides in nine individuals collected in natura. Up to five of the selected pesticides have been detected in one individual.",

            "abstract": "Developing ecological models for accurately predicting the dynamics of a population and individual physiological processes in field conditions is a challenging task for ecosystem management and ecological risk assessment. Here, we propose to assess the relevance of a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model calibrated using data previously generated from laboratory experiments for adult three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) living in semi-natural conditions. We compared different ways of integrating different data sets such as temperature and prey abundance obtained in mesocosm experiments to assess the predictive capacity of the model. By this study, we provide recommendations for developing an appropriate environmental scenario (e.g. natural variations of food and temperature) for using a DEB model in a field context. We conclude that a DEB model calibrated with laboratory data can be used to predict the physiological processes of an organism living in semi-natural conditions, but that the reproductive behaviour of the organism can affect the predictions. At last, we suggest that further studies on the feeding behaviour may be necessary for immature organisms.",

            "abstract": "Developing population models is of great interest as these models enable to extrapolate toxicity observed at the molecular or individual levels to the population level, and thus improve environmental risk assessment of chemical substances. For this purpose, accounting for natural variations of environmental conditions and prey dynamics along with the chemical stress is needed. In this study, an individual-based model (IBM) coupled to a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model was developed in order to predict three-spined stickleback population dynamics in semi-controlled stream experiments (in mesocosms). Datasets obtained in mesocosms offer the opportunity to develop and evaluate the model predictions. The most sensitive parameters of the DEB-IBM were identified by sensitivity analyses and were calibrated based on data from two independent mesocosm experiments. The predictive capacities of our model were subsequently evaluated using three independent mesocosm datasets under different environmental scenarios. Finally, our model was applied to a theoretical case of toxic effects to show an example of application of the model in a regulatory context. While the most uncertain population processes (in particular, competition for food in mesocosms) in our three-spined stickleback DEB-IBM could be modelled more accurately, our model can already serve to assess the impacts of toxicants at the population level by improving the analyses of mesocosm experiments, in decreasing the uncertainty of the experimental results. Therefore, in a second step, it could be used to predict the consequences on viability of a population exposed to a contaminant under various environmental and exposure scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA), a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical, is ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment. Its impacts at the population level on three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have been studied in artificial streams with low-dose BPA concentrations. The causes explaining the observed effects remained unclear. Here, we used an individual-based model coupled to a Dynamic Energy Budget model to (i) assess the potential of modelling to predict impacts at the population level using individual level laboratory ecotoxicological endpoints and (ii) provide insight on the mechanisms of BPA toxicity in these mesocosms. To do that, both direct and indirect effects of BPA on three-spined sticklebacks were incorporated in the model. Indeed, direct BPA effects on fish have been identified based on literature data whereas indirect effects on sticklebacks have been taken into account using sampling data of their prey from the exposed artificial streams. Results of the modelling showed that direct BPA effects on fish (impacts on gonad formation, growth, male reproductive behavior, eggs and larvae survival) mainly explained the three-spined stickleback population structure in the mesocosms, but indirect effects were not negligible. Hence, this study showed the potential of modelling in risk assessment to predict the impacts on fish population viability from behavioral and physiological effects measured on organisms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

            "abstract": "Summary The pace‐of‐life syndrome ( POLS ) hypothesis integrates covariation of life‐history traits along a fast–slow continuum and covariation of behavioural traits along a proactive–reactive personality continuum. Few studies have investigated these predicted life‐history/personality associations among species and between sexes. Furthermore, whether and how contaminants interfere with POLS patterns remains unexplored. We tested for covariation patterns in life history and in behaviour, and for life‐history/personality covariation among species, among individuals within species and between sexes. Moreover, we investigated whether pesticide exposure affects covariation between life history and behaviour and whether species and sexes with a faster POLS strategy have a higher sensitivity to pesticides. We reared larvae of four species of Ischnura damselflies in a common garden experiment with an insecticide treatment (chlorpyrifos absent/present) in the final instar. We measured four life‐history traits (larval growth rate during the pesticide treatment, larval development time, adult mass and life span) and two behavioural traits (larval feeding activity and boldness, each before and after the pesticide treatment). At the individual level, life‐history traits and behavioural traits aligned along a fast–slow and a proactive–reactive continuum, respectively. Species‐specific differences in life history, with fast‐lived species having a faster larval growth and development, a lower mass at emergence and a shorter life span, suggested that time constraints in the larval stage were predictably driving life‐history evolution both in the larval stage and across metamorphosis in the adult stage. Across species, females were consistently more slow‐lived than males, reflecting that a large body size and a long life span are generally more important for females. In contrast to the POLS hypothesis, there was only little evidence for the expected positive coupling between life‐history pace and proactivity. Pesticide exposure decreased larval growth rate and affected life‐history/personality covariation in the most fast‐lived species. Our study supports the existence of life‐history and behavioural continua with limited support for life‐history/personality covariation. Variation in digestive physiology may explain this decoupling of life history and behaviour and provide valuable mechanistic insights to understand and predict the occurrence of life‐history/personality covariation patterns.",

As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures. Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fastslow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.",

            "abstract": "A current challenge in predicting species responses to global change is to understand evolutionary responses to rapidly changing environments and novel environmental conditions. It has been hypothesised that the speed of evolution would be contingent uponhighly dependent on evolutionary constraints shaped by resource allocation trade-offs and other physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of traits. However, the majority of models employed to investigate life-history evolution remain phenomenological in nature. They fail to incorporate realistic mechanisms for the transfer and transformation of resources that are in accordance with the established laws of physics and chemistry. Our objective was therefore to explore the full range of life-history strategies that are genuinely available to organisms through realistic metabolic processes and to compare them with the predictions made by classical life-history theories. To this end, we employed the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory to model the energy allocation of individuals. We studied inter-individual variation by varying the value of energetic primary parameters (i.e. physiological processes) of the model, under constant environmental conditions (optimal temperature and ad libitum food source). Physiological processes that impact both growth and reproduction, such as energy acquisition, allocation and mobilisation, were found to reproduce the predictions of life-history theory to a certain extent. However, some discrepancies remained, mainly because DEB theory accounts for physiological retro-actions that are not articulated in lifehistory theories. For example, quicker growth had an indirect impact on reproduction and ageing through respectively increased resource acquisition and dilution of damage-inducing compounds. Based on those insights, we propose future directions to integrate physiology, and in particular metabolism, into models of life-history evolution.",

            "abstract": "Coevolution occurs when species interact to influence one another’s fitness, resulting in reciprocal evolutionary change. In many coevolving lineages, trait expression in one species is modified by the genotypes and phenotypes of the other, forming feedback loops reminiscent of models of intraspecific social evolution. Here, we adapt the theory of within-species social evolution, characterized by indirect genetic effects and social selection imposed by interacting individuals, to the case of interspecific interactions. In a trait-based model, we derive general expressions for multivariate evolutionary change in two species and the expected between-species covariance in evolutionary change when selection varies across space. We show that reciprocal interspecific indirect genetic effects can dominate the coevolutionary process and drive patterns of correlated evolution beyond what is expected from direct selection alone. In extreme cases, interspecific indirect genetic effects can lead to coevolution when selection does not covary between species or even when one species lacks genetic variance. Moreover, our model indicates that interspecific indirect genetic effects may interact in complex ways with cross-species selection to determine the course of coevolution. Importantly, our model makes empirically testable predictions for how different forms of reciprocal interactions contribute to the coevolutionary process.",

Soil contamination by PFAS is a major environmental concern, and there is a lack of knowledge on both their ecotoxicological mechanisms and the concentrations that induce adverse effects especially to non-target organisms, particularly in the case of PFAS mixtures. This study contributes to filling these gaps by assessing and modelling the effects of PFAS (in single and in mixtures for PFOS and PFOA at different environmental doses) on juvenile endogeic earthworms of a common species in European soils (Aporrectodea caliginosa) at different levels of biological organization (sub-individual and individual). The results showed for the first time combined strong ecotoxicological effects of PFAS on earthworm survival, integumental integrity, growth, sexual maturity and on genomic stability notably with the induction of DNA breaks associated with no abnormal oxidative DNA-lesion levels. Our results demonstrated significant effects at 0.3 mg kg 1 and additive effects in case of mixtures.",

            "abstract": "The field of eco-evolutionary dynamics is developing rapidly, with a growing number of well-designed experiments quantifying the impact of evolution on ecological processes and patterns, ranging from population demography to community composition and ecosystem functioning. The key challenge remains to transfer the insights of these proof-of-principle experiments to natural settings, where multiple species interact and the dynamics are far more complex than those studied in most experiments. Here, we discuss potential pitfalls of building a framework on eco-evolutionary dynamics that is based on data on single species studied in isolation from interspecific interactions, which can lead to both under- and overestimation of the impact of evolution on ecological processes. Underestimation of evolution-driven ecological changes could occur in a single-species approach when the focal species is involved in co-evolutionary dynamics, whereas overestimation might occur due to increased rates of evolution following ecological release of the focal species. In order to develop a multi-species perspective on eco-evolutionary dynamics, we discuss the need for a broad-sense definition of “eco-evolutionary feedbacks” that includes any reciprocal interaction between ecological and evolutionary processes, next to a narrow-sense definition that refers to interactions that directly feed back on the interactor that evolves. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of using more natural settings in eco-evolutionary studies by gradually adding complexity: (a) multiple interacting species within a guild, (b) food web interactions and (c) evolving metacommunities in multiple habitat patches in a landscape. A literature survey indicated that only a few studies on microbial systems so far developed a truly multi-species approach in their analysis of eco-evolutionary dynamics, and mostly so in artificially constructed communities. Finally, we provide a road map of methods to study eco-evolutionary dynamics in more natural settings. Eco-evolutionary studies involving multiple species are necessarily demanding and might require intensive collaboration among research teams, but are highly needed. A plain language summary is available for this article.",

Survival was observed to be a more sensitive end point than growth, and mortality mainly occurred during the initial stages of the exposure. This suggested that the mode of action of zinc toxicity was mainly of an acute nature. A review and analysis of existing literature demonstrated similar results for most other fish species investigated. Overall, up to a 30-fold variation of zinc toxicity was observed, as indicated by no observed effect concentrations varying between 32.7 and 974 microg of Zn L(-1). Increased concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and H+ (within the tested ranges) resulted in a reduction of chronic zinc toxicity by a factor of 12, 3, $>$2, and 2, respectively. This suggests the major importance of Ca competing with zinc and protecting against zinc toxicity, which seems to be a ubiquitous concept in fish species (and probably also invertebrate). On the basis of the toxicity data obtained, a chronic biotic ligand model (BLM) was developed that takes into account both chemical speciation of zinc and competition between zinc and the above-mentioned cations. The developed model was able to predict chronic effect concentrations with an error of less than a factor of 2 in most cases. Hence, it was concluded that the chronic Zn BLM can reduce toxicity variability due to bioavailability to a considerable extent and that the BLM can become an important tool in criteria setting and risk assessment practice of zinc and zinc substances.",

The toxicity of the three chemicals decreased in the order carbofuran $>$ chlorpyrifos $>$ mancozeb. In general, formulations were more toxic than the active ingredients, but differences in LC50 and ECx values were significant only in two cases and not more than a factor of 2.0. This could mainly be due to masking of the effects of additives in the soil. Comparison with available survival data revealed that P. excavatus is more sensitive than the standard test species Eisenia andrei or E. fetida. The use of tropical species in the risk assessment of pesticides in tropical regions should therefore be encouraged.",

            "abstract": "Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "Recognizing culture, and diverse sources of knowledge, can improve assessments , A major challenge today and into the future is to maintain or enhance beneficial contributions of nature to a good quality of life for all people. This is among the key motivations of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a joint global effort by governments, academia, and civil society to assess and promote knowledge of Earth’s biodiversity and ecosystems and their contribution to human societies in order to inform policy formulation. One of the more recent key elements of the IPBES conceptual framework ( 1 ) is the notion of nature’s contributions to people (NCP), which builds on the ecosystem service concept popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) ( 2 ). But as we detail below, NCP as defined and put into practice in IPBES differs from earlier work in several important ways. First, the NCP approach recognizes the central and pervasive role that culture plays in defining all links between people and nature. Second, use of NCP elevates, emphasizes, and operationalizes the role of indigenous and local knowledge in understanding nature’s contribution to people.",

            "abstract": "Mechanistic understanding of bioaccumulation in different organisms and environments should take into account the influence of organism and chemical depending factors on the uptake and elimination kinetics of chemicals. Lipophilicity, metabolism, sorption (bioavailability) and biodegradation of chemicals are among the important factors that may significantly affect the bioaccumulation process in soil organisms. This study attempts to model elimination kinetics of organic chemicals in earthworms by accounting for the effects of both chemical and biological properties, including metabolism. The modeling approach that has been developed is based on the concept for simulating metabolism used in the BCF base-line model developed for predicting bioaccumulation in fish. Metabolism was explicitly accounted for by making use of the TIMES engine for simulation of metabolism and a set of principal transformations. Kinetic characteristics of transformations were estimated on the basis of observed kinetics data for the elimination of organic chemicals from earthworms.",

            "abstract": "Summary Growing interest in proximate and ultimate causes and consequences of between‐ and within‐individual variation in labile components of the phenotype – such as behaviour or physiology – characterizes current research in evolutionary ecology. The study of individual variation requires tools for quantification and decomposition of phenotypic variation into between‐ and within‐individual components. This is essential as variance components differ in their ecological and evolutionary implications. We provide an overview of how mixed‐effect models can be used to partition variation in, and correlations among, phenotypic attributes into between‐ and within‐individual variance components. Optimal sampling schemes to accurately estimate (with sufficient power) a wide range of repeatabilities and key (co)variance components, such as between‐ and within‐individual correlations, are detailed. Mixed‐effect models enable the usage of unambiguous terminology for patterns of biological variation that currently lack a formal statistical definition (e.g. “animal personality” or “behavioural syndromes”), and facilitate cross‐fertilisation between disciplines such as behavioural ecology, ecological physiology and quantitative genetics.",

In earthworm ecotoxicity tests, the species Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei are commonly used, and there is evidence that these species respond relatively insensitive towards environmental pollution. With the present study, we wanted to evaluate the risk of underestimating effects of the insecticide imidacloprid in soil organisms by comparing E. fetida with two other earthworm species (Aporrectodea caliginosa and Lumbricus terrestris) regarding their sensitivities towards soil contaminated with this widely used insecticide.",

In the present study, we have therefore assessed short- and long-term effects on burrowing behaviour in the earthworm species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Lumbricus terrestris after exposure to a range of imidacloprid concentrations (0.2–4 mg kgÀ1 dry weight (DW)) for different exposure times (1, 7, 14 d). 2D-terraria were used for the examination of post-exposure short-term effects (24–96 h), while post-exposure long-term effects were assessed by means of X-ray burrow reconstruction in three dimensional soil cores (6 weeks). For the latter each core was incubated with two specimens of L. terrestris and four of A. calignosa. Short-term effects on the burrowing behaviour (2D) of A. caliginosa were already detected at the lowest test concentration (0.2 mg kgÀ1 DW), whereas such effects in L. terrestris were not observed until exposure to concentrations 10 times higher (2 mg kgÀ1 DW). For both species tested in the 2D-terraria, “‘total burrow length after 24 h’” and “‘maximal burrow depth after 24 h’” were the most sensitive endpoints. 3D reconstructions of the burrow systems made by both earthworm species in the repacked soil cores revealed a significant linear decrease in burrow volume with increasing imidacloprid concentration.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of genetic variation to phenotypes is a central factor in whether and how populations respond to selection.The most common approach to estimating these influences is via the calculation of heritabilities, which summarize the contribution of genetic variation to phenotypic variation. Heritabilities also indicate the relative effect of genetic variation on phenotypes versus that of environmental sources of variation. For labile traits like behavioral responses, life history traits, and physiological responses, estimation of heritabilities is important as these traits are strongly influenced by the environment. Thus, knowing whether or not genetic variation is present within populations is necessary to understand whether or not these populations can evolve in response to selection. Here we report the results of a meta-analysis summarizing what we currently know about the heritability of behavior. Using phylogenetically controlled methods we assessed the average heritability of behavior (0.235)—which is similar to that reported in previous analyses of physiological and life history traits—and examined differences among taxa, behavioral classifications, and other biologically relevant factors. We found that there was considerable variation among behaviors as to how heritable they were, with migratory behaviors being the most heritable. Interestingly, we found no effect of phylogeny on estimates of heritability. These results suggest, first, that behavior may not be particularly unique in the degree to which it is influenced by factors other than genetics and, second, that those factors influencing whether a behavioral trait will have low or high heritability require further consideration.",

            "abstract": "The present work aims to compare the sensitivity of embryos and adult zebrafish to chromium (VI) (as potassium dichromate) focusing on biomarkers (cholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase) as endpoints. Zebrafish eggs showed less sensitivity to Cr (VI) (96 h-LC50 = 145.7 mg/L) than adults (96 h-LC50 = 39.4 mg/L) probably due to the protective action of the chorion. However, biomarkers were much more responsive in larvae than in adults and gave clear indications about Cr (VI) mode of action: it seems to be neurotoxic (inhibited cholinesterase), to inhibit glutathione S-transferase activity and to interfere with cellular metabolic activity (changes in lactate dehydrogenase activity) in larvae. In adults, only glutathione S-transferase was responsive, showing a clear inhibition. The responsiveness of the analyzed biomarkers in larvae reinforces the idea of the usefulness of early life stage assays in the assessment of chemicals effects. Moreover, early life stage assays also contributed with relevant information regarding anomalies in larvae development and behavior. Further research should focus on the use of biomarkers to assess long term effects which are ecologically more relevant.",

A circular choice chamber containing 18 feeding stations was used to assess the food-type preference of four earthworm species (Aporrectodea caliginosa, A. longa, Lumbricus rubellus, L. terrestris). Representatives of each specieswere presented with four types of organic matter (cow dung, sheep dung, decomposed leaf litter, sewage sludge) either alone or mixed 1 to 4 (on a dry weight basis) with a sandy loam soil; soil alone was also tested in the same chamber. The nine types of potential food were each inoculated with Pseudomonas corrugata 2140R lux8 at a rate of 10’cfu (colony forming units) g-’ wet wt of material.",

            "abstract": "Background: Anthropogenic disturbances can lead to intense selection pressures on traits and very rapid evolutionary changes. Evolutionary responses to environmental changes, in turn, reflect changes in the genetic structure of the traits, accompanied by a reduction of evolutionary potential of the populations under selection. Assessing the effects of pollutants on the evolutionary responses and on the genetic structure of populations is thus important to understanding the mechanisms that entail specialization to novel environmental conditions or resistance to novel stressors. Results: Using an experimental evolution approach we exposed Caenorhabditis elegans populations to uranium, salt and alternating uranium-salt environments over 22 generations. We analyzed the changes in the average values of life history traits and the consequences at the demographic level in these populations. We also estimated the phenotypic and genetic (co)variance structure of these traits at different generations. Compared to populations in salt, populations in uranium showed a reduction of the stability of their trait structure and a higher capacity to respond by acclimation. However, the evolutionary responses of traits were generally lower for uranium compared to salt treatment; and the evolutionary responses to the alternating uranium–salt environment were between those of constant environments. Consequently, at the end of the experiment, the population rate of increase was higher in uranium than in salt and intermediate in the alternating environment. Conclusions: Our multigenerational experiment confirmed that rapid adaptation to different polluted environments may involve different evolutionary responses resulting in demographic consequences. These changes are partly explained by the effects of the pollutants on the genetic (co)variance structure of traits and the capacity of acclimation to novel conditions. Finally, our results in the alternating environment may confirm the selection of a generalist type in this environment.",

            "abstract": "Some populations quickly adapt to strong and novel selection pressures caused by anthropogenic stressors. However, this short-­term evolutionary response to novel and harsh environmental conditions may lead to adaptation costs, and evaluating these costs is important if we want to understand the evolution of resistance to anthropogenic stressors. In this experimental evolution study, we exposed Caenorhabditis elegans populations to uranium (U populations), salt (NaCl populations) and alternating uranium/salt treatments (U/NaCl populations) and to a control environment (C populations), over 22 generations. In parallel, we ran common-­ garden and reciprocal-­transplant experiments to assess the adaptive costs for populations that have evolved in the different environmental conditions. Our results showed rapid evolutionary changes in life history characteristics of populations exposed to the different pollution regimes. Furthermore, adaptive costs depended on the type of pollutant: pollution-­adapted populations had lower fitness than C populations, when the populations were returned to their original environment. Fitness in uranium environments was lower for NaCl populations than for U populations. In contrast, fitness in salt environments was similar between U and NaCl populations. Moreover, fitness of U/NaCl populations showed similar or higher fitness in both the uranium and the salt environments compared to populations adapted to constant uranium or salt environments. Our results show that adaptive evolution to a particular stressor can lead to either adaptive costs or benefits once in contact with another stressor. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence that adaptation to alternating stressors was associated with additional adaption costs. This study highlights the need to incorporate adaptive cost assessments when undertaking ecological risk assessments of pollutants.",

            "abstract": "General protection goals are stated in European legislation but specific protection goals (SPGs) are not precisely defined. These are however crucial for designing appropriate risk assessment schemes. Here a process for defining SPG options is presented, which uses the ecosystem services approach as an overarching concept and could be used in consultation processes with risk managers and stakeholders. SPGs are defined in 6 dimensions: biological entity, attribute, magnitude of effect, temporal and geographical scale of the effect, and the degree of certainty that the specified level of effect will not be exceeded. SPG options are presented for 7 key drivers (microbes, algae, non target plants (aquatic and terrestrial), aquatic invertebrates, terrestrial non target arthropods including honeybees, terrestrial non-arthropod invertebrates, and vertebrates), covering all ecosystem services which could potentially be affected by the use of pesticides. To ensure ecosystem services, taxa representative for the key drivers identified need to be protected at the population level or higher. However, for aesthetic reasons (cultural ecosystem services) it may be decided to protect vertebrates at the individual level. To protect biodiversity, impacts at least need to be assessed at the scale of the watershed/landscape. The Panel also emphasizes the importance of a tiered approach for risk assessment, the essential linking of exposure and effect assessments in terms of spatial and temporal scales, and the relevance of ecological scenarios for appropriate pesticide risk assessments. It intends to use the presented concepts as input for the dialogue between risk managers and risk assessors during the next steps of the revision of the Ecotoxicology Guidance Documents.",

            "abstract": "EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) was tasked to revise the Guidance Document (GD) on Aquatic Ecotoxicology under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (SANCO/3268/2001 rev.4 (final), 17 October 2002). This Guidance of the PPR Panel is the first of three requested deliverables within this mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1 and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps. An executive summary joining all parts of the guidance and decision schemes in a concise way is provided and is intended to help applicants and regulatory authorities in day-to-day use.",

            "abstract": "Following a request from the European Food Safety Authority, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues developed an opinion on the science to support the development of a risk assessment scheme of plant (crop) protection products on non-target terrestrial plants (NTTPs). This scientific opinion is largely a literature review on the most up-to-date knowledge of factors influencing phytotoxicity testing and risk assessment of NTTPs. Specific protection goals (SPGs) were defined for off-field, in-field and endangered species. SPGs are closely linked to ecosystem services and functions, and include maintaining provision of water regulation, food web support, aesthetic values, genetic resources and biodiversity. Gaps were identified in standard guidelines currently used in lower tier testing (tier I/II). In these guidelines, tests are conducted at the seedling/juvenile stage using mostly annual crops, and effects are recorded at the juvenile/vegetative stage under greenhouse conditions with plants grown individually or in monoculture. Endpoints measured do not include the overall effect on the whole life cycle (germinating seeds, seedling, juvenile stages, flowering, and seed production and germinability). It is also noted that it is unknown whether the following groups of organisms are covered by the plant risk assessment as it is carried out now: ferns, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, horsetails, lichens or woody species. In terms of exposure, droplet drift is considered to be the most important factor for off-field emissions to non-target areas. Models are available to calculate loadings from spray drift. Higher tier assessment is not required if the risk based on the tier II level can be managed by risk mitigation measures. When required, higher tier tests should be conducted under more realistic conditions. They may include additional laboratory/greenhouse tests (e.g. to measure reproductive endpoints or species interactions), microcosms or field experiments with experimentally or already established species. Other issues were considered, including exposure to mixtures, adjuvants, co-formulants and metabolites. Recommendations for the improvement of current guidelines and the elaboration of new guidelines and risk assessment schemes are provided.",

            "abstract": "The Panel has interpreted the Terms of Reference as a stepwise analysis of issues relevant to both the development and the evaluation of models to assess ecological effects of pesticides. The regulatory model should be selected or developed to address the relevant specific protection goal. The basis of good modelling practice must be the knowledge of relevant processes and the availability of data of sufficient quality. The opinion identifies several critical steps in order to set models within risk assessment, namely: problem formulation, considering the specific protection goals for the taxa or functional groups of concern; model domain of applicability, which drives the species and scenarios to model; species (and life stage) selection, considering relevant life history traits and toxicological/toxicokinetics characteristics of the pesticide; selection of the environmental scenario, which is defined by a combination of abiotic, biotic and agronomic parameters to provide a realistic worst-case situation. Model development should follow the modelling cycle, in which every step has to be fully documented: (i) problem definition; (ii) model formulation, i.e. design of a conceptual model; (iii) model formalisation, in which variables and parameters are linked together into mathematical equations or algorithms; (iv) model implementation, in which a computer code is produced and verified; (v) model setup, including sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis and comparison with observed data, that delivers the regulatory model; (vi) prior to actual use in risk assessment, the regulatory model should be evaluated for relevance to the specific protection goals; (vii) feedback from risk assessor with possible recommendations for model improvement. Model evaluation by regulatory authorities should consider each step of the modelling cycle: the opinion identifies points of particular attention for the use of mechanistic effect models in pesticide risk assessment. It is recommended that models be documented in a complete and transparent way, that a feedback platform be established involving risk assessors and model developers, and that a set of agreed models be made available.",

A new risk assessment scheme is suggested which integrates modelling approaches. The main exposure routes for non-target arthropods are identified and proposals are made on how to integrate them in the risk assessment. The appropriateness of the currently used vegetation distribution factor was investigated. It is proposed that new tests be included in order to address exposure via oral uptake of residues and uncertainties related to differences in species sensitivity.",

The current risk assessment scheme is reviewed, taking into account new regulatory frameworks and scientific developments. Proposals are made for specific protection goals for in-soil organisms being key drivers for relevant ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes such as nutrient cycling, soil structure, pest control and biodiversity. Considering the time-scales and biological processes related to the dispersal of the majority of in-soil organisms compared to terrestrial non-target arthropods living above soil, the Panel proposes that in-soil environmental risk assessments are made at in- and off-field scale considering field boundary levels. A new testing strategy which takes into account the relevant exposure routes for in-soil organisms and the potential direct and indirect effects is proposed.

The coverage of the risk to amphibians and reptiles by current risk assessments for other vertebrate groups was investigated. Available test methods and exposure models were reviewed with regard to their applicability to amphibians and reptiles. Proposals were made for specific protection goals aiming to protect important ecosystem services and taking into consideration the regulatory framework and existing protection goals for other vertebrates. Uncertainties, knowledge gaps and research needs were highlighted.",

            "abstract": "Following a request from EFSA, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) developed an opinion on the state of the art of Toxicokinetic/Toxicodynamic (TKTD) models and their use in prospective environmental risk assessment (ERA) for pesticides and aquatic organisms. TKTD models are species- and compound-specific and can be used to predict (sub)lethal effects of pesticides under untested (time-variable) exposure conditions. Three different types of TKTD models are described, viz., (i) the “General Unified Threshold models of Survival” (GUTS), (ii) those based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory (DEBtox models), and (iii) models for primary producers. All these TKTD models follow the principle that the processes influencing internal exposure of an organism, (TK), are separated from the processes that lead to damage and effects/mortality (TD). GUTS models can be used to predict survival rate under untested exposure conditions. DEBtox models explore the effects on growth and reproduction of toxicants over time, even over the entire life cycle. TKTD model for primary producers and pesticides have been developed for algae, Lemna and Myriophyllum. For all TKTD model calibration, both toxicity data on standard test species and/or additional species can be used. For validation, substance and species-specific data sets from independent refined-exposure experiments are required. Based on the current state of the art (e.g. lack of documented and evaluated examples), the DEBtox modelling approach is currently limited to research applications. However, its great potential for future use in prospective ERA for pesticides is recognised. The GUTS model and the Lemna model are considered ready to be used in risk assessment.",

            "abstract": "This Guidance document describes harmonised risk assessment methodologies for combined exposure to multiple chemicals for all relevant areas within EFSA’s remit, i.e. human health, animal health and ecological areas. First, a short review of the key terms, scientific basis for combined exposure risk assessment and approaches to assessing (eco)toxicology is given, including existing frameworks for these risk assessments. This background was evaluated, resulting in a harmonised framework for risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals. The framework is based on the risk assessment steps (problem formulation, exposure assessment, hazard identification and characterisation, and risk characterisation including uncertainty analysis), with tiered and stepwise approaches for both whole mixture approaches and component-based approaches. Specific considerations are given to component-based approaches including the grouping of chemicals into common assessment groups, the use of dose addition as a default assumption, approaches to integrate evidence of interactions and the refinement of assessment groups. Case studies are annexed in this guidance document to explore the feasibility and spectrum of applications of the proposed methods and approaches for human and animal health and ecological risk assessment. The Scientific Committee considers that this Guidance is fit for purpose for risk assessments of combined exposure to multiple chemicals and should be applied in all relevant areas of EFSA’s work. Future work and research are recommended.",

            "abstract": "We apply a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model to the Icelandic capelin (Mallotus villosus) and introduce a new state variable to capture the roe production of individual fish. Species-specific coefficients are found for the capelin such as the shape-coefficient and the Arrhenius temperature. We show how to link the DEB model to measurable quantities such as weight, length, fat, and roe content. We use data on measured three year old female capelin from the 1999-2000 season from the Marine Research Institute of Iceland (MRI) and Matis, an Icelandic Food and Biotech R&D. We then find plausible parameter values for the DEB model by fitting the output of the model to these data. We obtain good fits between theory and observations, and the DEB model successfully reproduces weight, length, fat percentage and roe percentage of capelin. We discuss the effect of maturity on the spawning route of capelin, and describe how we intend to incorporate these results with an interacting particle model for the spawning migration of capelin.",

Bayesian inference incorporates an investigator’s prior knowledge of parameters while using the data to update this knowledge. As such, Bayesian tools are well-s­ uited to infer PBPK model parameters using the strong prior knowledge available while quantifying the uncertainty on these parameters. This tutorial demonstrates a full population Bayesian PBPK analysis framework using R/Stan/ Torsten and Julia/SciML/Turing.jl.",

Across all three areas, hierarchical models, especially Bayesian hierarchical modeling, offer substantial benefits over classical, non-hierarchical approaches. After discussing each of these topics, we explore some recent developments in the use of hierarchical models for causal inference and conclude with some thoughts on new directions for this research area.",

For more than a century, chaos has surrounded this complex; morphological criteria has failed to solve the taxonomic status of these species. This present body of work aims to study the phylogeny of this complex by increasing the number of samples used in previous molecular works and by including morphologically-similar species that were never studied using molecular tools (A. giardi, Nicodrilus monticola, N. carochensis and N. tetramammalis). Two basal clades were obtained: one formed by A. caliginosa and A. tuberculata and the other by the rest of the species. This second clade was divided into two more: one with Eurosiberian and another with Mediterranean forms. A. caliginosa and A. longa were divided into two paraphyletic groups. Both A. giardi and A. nocturna showed characteristics consistent with monophyletic groups. Each of the two recovered lineages of A. trapezoides were phylogenetically related to different sexual species. While lineage I of A. trapezoides was monophyletic, lineage II resulted to be paraphyletic, as well as the three Nicodrilus “species”. The diversification of the complex occurred during the Late Miocene–Early Pliocene (6.92–11.09 Mya). The parthenogenetic forms within the Mediterranean clade would have diversified before the ones in the Eurosiberian clade (3.13–4.64 Mya and 1.05–3.48 Mya, respectively), thus implying the existence not only of at least two different moments in which parthenogenesis arose within this complex of species, but also of two different and independent evolutionary lines. Neither the 4Â rule nor the GMYC method for species delimitation were successful for distinguishing taxonomically-distinct species.",

            "abstract": "In four countries (France, Greece, Italy, and Sweden) occurrence in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and ecotoxicity of the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and diclofenac were investigated. Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, microcrustaceans, and fishes in order to calculate their predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) and to perform a first approach of risk characterization. For this aim, risk has been estimated by the predicted environmental concentration/PNEC ratio and the measured environmental concentration/PNEC ratio. First, regarding the PNEC, carbamazepine appears to be the more hazardous compound. Second, even though it is demonstrated that carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and diclofenac have been detected in effluents, only carbamazepine have been detected in all sewage treatment plants with the greatest concentrations. Third, risk quotients greater than unity were calculated only for carbamazepine, suggesting that risk for the water compartment is expected. r 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "In this study, exposure and ecotoxicity data of six human pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, ofloxacin, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole) were collected, including our own experimental data and literature data. From this data collection, the two-tiered European draft guideline on the environmental risk assessment of human pharmaceuticals was tested. Measured environmental concentrations in effluents from France and in effluents and surface waters from Germany were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in both countries. In a similar manner, predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) derived from acute data and PNECs derived from chronic data were estimated for each pharmaceutical and corresponding PEC/PNEC ratios then were compared in both countries. Globally, results demonstrated that all environmental concentrations (predicted or measured) for each considered pharmaceutical exceeded the 10-ng/L cutoff value, which requires the implementation of the second-tier assessment based on ecotoxicity data. Moreover, the six pharmaceuticals showed a relatively limited acute toxicity, and carbamazepine and propranolol were inaccurately identified as having negligible risks under the current European draft procedure. Such results lead to discussion of the actual procedure on pharmaceuticals, especially on the need of appropriate ecotoxicity tests.",

The two main objectives were (i) to extend our knowledge on chemicals occurring in treated wastewater, and (ii) to identify and prioritize compounds of concern based on three different risk assessment approaches for the identification of consensus mixture risk drivers of concern. Approaches include (i) PNEC and EQS-based regu­ latory risk quotients (RQs), (ii) species sensitivity distribution (SSD)-based hazard units (HUs) and (iii) toxic units (TUs) for three biological quality elements (BQEs) algae, crustacean, and fish.",

            "abstract": "A range of new statistical approaches is being developed and/or adopted in ecotoxicology that, when combined, can greatly improve the estimation of no‐effect toxicity values from concentration–response (CR) experimental data. In particular, we compare the existing no‐effect‐concentration (NEC) threshold‐based toxicity metric with an alternative no‐significanteffect‐concentration (NSEC) metric suitable for when CR data do not show evidence of a threshold effect. Using a modelaveraging approach, these metrics can be combined to yield estimates of N(S)EC and of their uncertainty within a single analysis framework. The outcome is a framework for CR analysis that is robust to uncertainty in the model formulation, and for which resulting estimates can be confidently integrated into risk assessment frameworks, such as the species sensitivity distribution (SSD).

            "abstract": "For decades, we have known that chemicals affect human and wildlife behavior. Moreover, due to recent technological and computational advances, scientists are now increasingly aware that a wide variety of contaminants and other environmental stressors adversely affect organismal behavior and subsequent ecological outcomes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. There is also a groundswell of concern that regulatory ecotoxicology does not adequately consider behavior, primarily due to a lack of standardized toxicity methods. This has, in turn, led to the exclusion of many behavioral ecotoxicology studies from chemical risk assessments. To improve understanding of the challenges and opportunities for behavioral ecotoxicology within regulatory toxicology/risk assessment, a unique workshop with international representatives from the fields of behavioral ecology, ecotoxicology, regulatory (eco)toxicology, neurotoxicology, test standardization, and risk assessment resulted in the formation of consensus perspectives and recommendations, which promise to serve as a roadmap to advance interfaces among the basic and translational sciences, and regulatory practices.",

            "abstract": "Biological diversity is threatened by exploitation, fragmentation of natural habitats, pollution, climate change, and anthropogenic spread of species. The question of how among‐individual variation influences the performance of populations and species is a poorly explored but currently growing field of research. Here, we review 31 experimental and 14 comparative studies and first investigate whether there is empirical support for the propositions that higher levels of among‐individual phenotypic and genetic variation promote the ecological and evolutionary success of populations and species in the face of environmental change. Next, we examine whether and how the effect of diversity depends on environmental conditions. Finally, we explore whether the relationship linking population fitness to diversity is typically linear, asymptotic, or whether the benefits peak at intermediate diversity. The reviewed studies provide strong, almost invariable, evidence that more variable populations are less vulnerable to environmental changes, show decreased fluctuations in population size, have superior establishment success, larger distribution ranges, and are less extinction prone, compared with less variable populations or species. Given the overwhelming evidence that variation promotes population performance, it is important to identify conditions when increased variation does not have the theoretically expected effect, a question of considerable importance in biodiversity management, where there are many other practical constraints. We find that experimental outcomes generally support the notion that genetic and phenotypic variation is of greater importance under more stressful than under benign conditions. Finally, population performance increased linearly with increasing diversity in the majority (10 of 12) of manipulation studies that included four or more diversity levels; only two experiments detected curvilinear relationships.",

            "abstract": "Industrial chemicals have been in use for many decades and new products are regularly invented and introduced to the market. Also for decades, many different chemical laws have been introduced to regulate safe handling of chemicals in different use patterns. The patchwork of current regulation in the European Union is to be replaced by the new regulation on industrial chemical control, REACH. REACH stands for registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals. REACH entered force on June 1, 2007. REACH aims to overcome limitations in testing requirements of former regulation on industrial chemicals to enhance competitiveness and innovation with regard to manufacture safer substances and to promote the development of alternative testing methods. A main task of REACH is to address data gaps regarding the properties and uses of industrial chemicals. Producers, importers, and downstream users will have to compile and communicate standard information for all chemicals. Information sets to be prepared include safety data sheets (SDS), chemical safety reports (CSR), and chemical safety assessments (CSA). These are designed to guarantee adequate handling in the production chain, in transport and in use and to prevent the substances from being released to and distributed within the environment. Another important aim is to identify the most harmful chemicals and to set incentives to substitute them with safer alternatives. On one hand, REACH will have substantial impact on the basic understanding of the evaluation of chemicals. However, the toxicological sciences can also substantially influence the workability of REACH that supports the transformation of data to the information required to understand and manage acceptable and non acceptable risks in the use of industrial chemicals. The REACH regulation has been laid down in the main document and 17 Annexes of more than 849 pages. Even bigger technical guidance documents will follow and will inform about the rules for application and work out of dossiers. The following article gives a comprehensive overview on the concept of REACH to give deeper insight into this document. Members of the scientific community will have to define their own position as researchers, teachers, and experts to support the efforts to protect human health and the environment. The concept of REACH as well as new approaches to adapt standard testing regimes to foster a risk oriented approach in required work load to decrease animal based tests and to strengthen weight of evidence are explained in detail in this article.",

            "abstract": "This position paper intends to stimulate a profound rethinking of contemporary agricultural practice. We criticise the current intensity of chemical plant protection in Germany as ecologically unsustainable and thus threatening the achievement of key targets of environmental protection and nature conservation policies. In the first part of the paper, we provide background information on the use of plant protection products (PPP) in German agriculture, the role of agricultural policy, European pesticide legislation, the principles of and framework for environmental risk assessment and risk management of PPP, as well as environmental effects of PPP. The second part is presented against the backdrop of the European \"Sustainable Use Directive\" (2009/128/EC). This directive requires that \"Member States shall adopt National Action Plans to set up their quantitative objectives, targets, measures, and timetables to reduce risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment and to encourage the development and introduction of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques to reduce dependency on the use of pesticides.\" Reflecting on the corresponding debate in Germany, we suggest the following five key principles for a sustainable use of PPP and provide recommendations for their implementation: (1) minimising use; (2) identifying, quantifying, and communicating risks; (3) optimising risk management; (4) compensating for unavoidable effects; (5) internalising external costs.",

            "abstract": "Contamination of the environment by pesticide residues is a growing concern given their widespread presence in the environment and their effects on ecosystems. Only a few studies have addressed the occurrence of pesticides in soils, and their results highlighted the need for further research on the persistence and risks induced by those substances. We monitored 111 pesticide residues (48 fungicides, 36 herbicides, 25 insecticides and/or acaricides, and two safeners) in 47 soils sampled across France under various land uses (arable lands, vineyards, orchards, forests, grasslands, and brownfields). Pesticides were found in 98% of the sites (46 of the 47 sampled), including untreated areas such as organic fields, forests, grasslands, and brownfields, with up to 33 different substances detected in one sample, mostly fungicides and herbicides. The concentrations of herbicides were the highest in soils with glyphosate, and its transformation product, AMPA, contributed 70% of the cumulative herbicides. Risk assessment underlined a moderate to high risk for earthworms in arable soils mostly attributed to insecticides and/or acaricides. Finally, the comparison with pesticide application by farmers underlines the presence of some residues long after their supposed 90% degradation and at concentrations higher than predicted environmental concentrations, leading to questions their real persistence in soils.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms are among the most important soil fauna. To exert effects on soils, they need to be active. Earthworm presence is often used as an indicator for activity, but this is not always reliable as earthworms may survive long periods of inactivity or even estivation. Other direct, reliable, and objective measurements for earthworm activity are lacking. Here, we present a novel earthworm activity measurement, based on body-density difference between actively feeding and inactive earthworms. The underlying principle is that active earthworms have a higher density as their gut is filled with soil particles, while inactive earthworms generally have an empty gut. The method therefore separates inactive earthworms from active ones by flotation. To achieve separation, a 1.08 g cm 3 sucrose solution is used. Since it is well established that earthworm activity is reduced in dry soil conditions, we set up a soil moisture gradient experiment to gain a range in earthworm activity. We tested our method on four common European earthworms (endogeic species Allolobophora chlorotica [Savigny] and Aporrectodea caliginosa [Savigny], anecic species Aporrectodea longa [Ude] and epigeic species Lumbricus rubellus [Hoffmeister]) in an experiment with three soil moisture levels (84, 126 and 168 mL kg 1) using a sandy topsoil. As additional proxy for earthworm activity, estivation was visually recorded. We found a high inter-method correlation between density-based and visually estimated earthworm activity, regardless of earthworm species and moisture treatment. Furthermore, our novel method detected inactive individuals of L. rubellus, a species without the ability of estivation. We demonstrated that our density-based method allows for easy and quick quantification of active earthworms. This method offers clear advantages over visual assessments of estivation or cast production, in particular objectivity and applicability to a wider range of species, including those that do not enter estivation.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Earthworms play a key role in soil carbon mineralization, but their effect is highly uncertain and suspected to vary as a function of several factors, particularly the earthworm density and time from earthworm inoculation. We conducted a meta-analysis considering these factors based on 42 experiments comparing carbon mineralization in the absence and presence of earthworms at different times. The results reveal an average carbon mineralization increase of 24% (sd 41%) in the presence of earthworms with an initial median earthworm density of 1.95 mg/g soil DM (Dry Mass) (sd 48%). We show that carbon mineralization due to earthworms was related to their density and time from inoculation. From a simple regression model using these two variables, the estimated impact of earthworms on carbon mineralization was 20% increase from 0 to 60 days and 14% decrease at day 350 for a density of worms commonly found in soils (0.5 mg/g soil DM). Finally, we proposed a simple equation that could be used in organic matter decomposition models that do not take macrofauna into account.",

            "abstract": "Humans currently occupy all continents and by doing so, modify the environment and create novel threats to many species; a phenomenon known as human-induced rapid environmental changes (HIREC). These growing anthropogenic disturbances represent major and relatively new environmental challenges for many animals, and invariably alter selection on traits adapted to previous environments. Those species that survive often have moved from their original habitat or modified their phenotype through plasticity or genetic evolution. Based on the most recent advances in this research area, we predict that wild individuals with highly plastic capacities, relatively high basal stress level, and that are generally shy—in other words, individuals displaying a reactive phenotype—should better cope with sudden and widespread HIREC than their counterparts’ proactive phenotypes. If true, this selective response would have profound ecological and evolutionary consequences and can therefore impact conservation strategies, specifically with respect to managing the distribution and abundance of individuals and maintaining evolutionary potential. These insights may help design adaptive management strategies to maintain genetic variation in the context of HIREC.",

Here with the help of a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model, we explored whether differential body sizes might explain the observed variability in sensitivity between species and between life-stages of each individual species, for three model organisms, Daphnia magna, Chaoborus crystallinus and Mesocyclops leuckarti. While body size-dependent toxicokinetics could be used to predict intraspecies variation in sensitivity, our results also suggest that changes in both toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic parameters might be needed to describe differential species sensitivity. Accounting for biological traits, like body size, in mechanistic effect models will allow more accurate predictions of chemical effects in size structured populations, ultimately providing mechanistic explanations for species sensitivity distributions.",

            "abstract": "In our laboratory studies, earthworms showed a decrease in burrowing activity with decreasing moisture levels and, to some extent, the organic matter content. The burrowing activity of earthworms was also affected by temperature, for which the casts produced per earthworm was used as a proxy in laboratory experiments. We integrated changes in earthworm movement and life histories in response to temperature, soil organic matter content and the moisture level, as observed in our experiment and reported in the literature, through dynamic energy budget (DEB) modelling. The joint parametrization of a DEB model for A. caliginosa based on movement and life history data revealed that food ingestion via movement is an integral part of the earthworms’ energy budgets. Our findings highlight the importance of soil properties to be considered in the model development for earthworms. Furthermore, by understanding and incorporating the effect of environmental factors on the physiology, this mechanistic approach can help assess the impact of environmental changes such as temperature rise or drought.",

            "abstract": "A novel experimental system to establish and maintain constant dissolved concentrations of poorly water-soluble compounds for bioconcentration experiments with algae was developed. Although still recommended in the literature as a “‘non-adsorptive’” material, a commercially available Teflon stir bar that was preloaded with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) proved to be an effective donor for partitioning controlled delivery. When placed in a bioconcentration test chamber, the PCB concentrations in water and in the headspace remained constant for up to 8 days. Henry’s law constants determined in experiments using water only were in good accordance with values found in the literature, indicating that the chemical was truly dissolved. When algae (Emiliana huxleyi, class prymnesiophyceae) were added to the chamber, the water and air concentrations varied initially but stabilised within several hours, and smooth uptake curves were obtained for the algae. This indicates that the contamination system compensates for chemical loss from the water column. In addition, the Henry’s law constants and the headspace measurements were used to estimate what fraction of the PCB in filtered water was associated with dissolved organic carbon, opening the opportunity to constrain one of the major artefacts in bioconcentration experiments.",

Limited in its direct application to binary mixtures, isobolographic analysis provides a conceptual framework and an unambiguous terminology, as well as an algebraic paradigm for the analysis of the interaction of ternary and higher order mixtures. A library of examples generously illustrated graphically is provided to facilitate the understanding of the methodology and serve as a guide for investigators who are unfamiliar with the approach. Also discussed are the theoretical derivation of the isobologram, the representation of various dosage combinations, the derivation of the principle of dose additivity, supra-additivity, infra-additivity, antagonism, the methods for probit analysis of mixture potency, effect addition and the consequences of peak effect coincidence in time or lack thereof, and the role of isobolographic analysis in the various aspects of dose-response surface methodology.",

Five fields within a joint agricultural area exhibited different chemical and farming histories from conventional cultivation to organic pasture. Soil multiresidual pesticide analysis revealed up to 9 molecules including atrazine up to 2.4 ng gÀ1 dry soil. Exposure history of endogeic Aporrectodea caliginosa and Allolobophora chlorotica modified their responses to pesticides. In the field, activities of soluble glutathione-Stransferases (sGST) and catalase increased with soil pesticide contamination in A. caliginosa. Pesticide stress was reflected in depletion of energy reserves in A. chlorotica. Acute exposure of pre-adapted and naïve A. caliginosa to pesticides (fungicide OpusÒ, 0.1 mg active ingredient epoxiconazole gÀ1 dry soil, RoundUp FlashÒ, 2.5 mg active ingredient glyphosate gÀ1 dry soil, and their mixture), revealed that environmental pre-exposure accelerated activation of the detoxification enzyme sGST towards epoxiconazole.",

They are not completely eliminated through conventional wastewater treatment and are subsequently released into the aquatic environment. More advanced treatment is required for the effective reduction of the quantity of pharmaceuticals entering the environment. Among the available technical treatments, tertiary ozonation has proved an economically feasible and highly effective way of removing a wide range of contaminants. Like other oxidative treatments, ozonation leads to major changes in the water composition. Consequently, it is important to evaluate the toxic potential of the treated effluent through relevant ecotoxicological end points.",

            "abstract": "The ubiquitous free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful animal model for measuring the evolutionary effects of pollutants which is increasingly used in (eco) toxicological studies. Indeed, toxicity tests with this nematode can provide in a few days data on the whole life cycle. These data can be analysed with mathematical tools such as toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modelling approaches. In this study, we assessed how a chronic exposure to a radioactive heavy metal (uranium) affects the life-cycle of C. elegans using a mechanistic model. In order to achieve this, we exposed individuals to a range of seven concentrations of uranium. Growth and reproduction were followed daily. These data were analysed with a model for nematodes based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory, able to handle a wide range of plausible biological parameters values. Parameter estimations were performed using a Bayesian framework. Our results showed that uranium affects the assimilation of energy from food with a no-effect concentration (NEC) of 0.42 mM U which would be the threshold for effects on both growth and reproduction. The sensitivity analysis showed that the main contributors to the model output were parameters linked to the feeding processes and the actual exposure concentration. This confirms that the real exposure concentration should be measured accurately and that the feeding parameters should not be fixed, but need to be reestimated during the parameter estimation process.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the evolutionary responses of long-term exposed populations requires multigeneration ecotoxicity tests. However, the analysis of the data from these tests is not straightforward. Mechanistic models allow the in-depth analysis of the variation of physiological traits over many generations, by quantifying the trend of the physiological and toxicological parameters of the model. In the present study, a bioenergetic mechanistic model has been used to assess the evolution of two populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in control conditions or exposed to uranium. This evolutionary pressure resulted in a brood size reduction of 60%. We showed an adaptation of individuals of both populations to experimental conditions (increase of maximal length, decrease of growth rate, decrease of brood size, and decrease of the elimination rate). In addition, differential evolution was also highlighted between the two populations once the maternal effects had been diminished after several generations. Thus, individuals that were greater in maximal length, but with apparently a greater sensitivity to uranium were selected in the uranium population. In this study, we showed that this bioenergetics mechanistic modeling approach provided a precise, certain, and powerful analysis of the life strategy of C. elegans populations exposed to heavy metals resulting in an evolutionary pressure across successive generations.",

            "abstract": "Soils can be sinks of pollutant mixtures, whose effects on terrestrial ecosystems are not of obvious interpretation. Risk assessment is rather codified and many approaches can be used. Nevertheless, there are still uncertainties remaining when dealing with diffuse pollution, including chronic inputs of low, sublethal, concentrations of mixtures of micropollutants. In this paper, we reviewed through a comprehensive literature analysis one of the latest promising methodologies, the triad approach, in order to understand its area of application in terrestrial ecosystems, the ways of applicability and the reported actual usage. In the case of diffuse pollution, where all the criteria of the triad approach can differ in their indication, we show that some improvements have to be made in either the chemical, ecological or ecotoxicological approaches to be able to clearly identify the risk and to address the uncertainties linked to the low, sublethal contents of contaminants.",

            "abstract": "Challenges to the use of the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) in ecotoxicology have appeared over the years, with a recent call for banning its use in favor of the x% effects concentration (ECx). This article presents an opposing view, providing reasons for the continued use of the NOEC, and for hypothesis testing in general. Although the use of ECx values is appropriate in many situations, there are numerous real-world examples where it is not suitable and offers no advantage over the use of hypothesis testing. These examples are presented with recommended data analysis techniques, illustrating the variety of statistical approaches that are meaningful in analyzing ecotoxicity data. Thoughtful consideration of study design and proper analysis and interpretation of the results will go further to advance the science of ecotoxicology than attempting to implement a blanket prohibition or endorsement of any single statistical approach.

Here, we present individual, decision-tree style, strategies for the eleven major toxicity endpoints of the REACH system, including human health effects and ecotoxicity. These strategies make maximum use of non-animal approaches to hazard identification, before resorting to traditional animal test methods. Each scheme: a) comprises a mixture of validated and non-validated assays (distinguished in the schemes); and b) decision points at key stages to allow the cessation of further testing, should it be possible to use the available information to classify and label and/or undertake risk assessment. The rationale and scientific justification for each of the schemes, with respect to the validation status of the tests involved and their individual advantages and limitations, will be discussed in detail in a series of future publications.",

In an extension of linear isobole theory, models are quantitatively developed to describe these combinations, in which the nature of the nonideal effect combination may or may not be a function of the magnitude of predicted response (as opposed to only the proportions of the substances in a mixture). The approach is tested using data on rat carcinogenesis, drug action, and aquatic toxicity of pesticides. In the cases examined, the models predict substantial deviation from ideal behavior even under low doses.",

            "abstract": "Humans are concomitantly exposed to numerous chemicals. An infinite number of combinations and doses thereof can be imagined. For toxicological risk assessment the mathematical prediction of mixture effects, using knowledge on single chemicals, is therefore desirable. We investigated pros and cons of the concentration addition (CA), independent action (IA) and generalized concentration addition (GCA) models. First we measured effects of single chemicals and mixtures thereof on steroid synthesis in H295R cells. Then single chemical data were applied to the models; predictions of mixture effects were calculated and compared to the experimental mixture data. Mixture 1 contained environmental chemicals adjusted in ratio according to human exposure levels. Mixture 2 was a potency adjusted mixture containing five pesticides. Prediction of testosterone effects coincided with the experimental Mixture 1 data. In contrast, antagonism was observed for effects of Mixture 2 on this hormone. The mixtures contained chemicals exerting only limited maximal effects. This hampered prediction by the CA and IA models, whereas the GCA model could be used to predict a full dose response curve. Regarding effects on progesterone and estradiol, some chemicals were having stimulatory effects whereas others had inhibitory effects. The three models were not applicable in this situation and no predictions could be performed. Finally, the expected contributions of single chemicals to the mixture effects were calculated. Prochloraz was the predominant but not sole driver of the mixtures, suggesting that one chemical alone was not responsible for the mixture effects. In conclusion, the GCA model seemed to be superior to the CA and IA models for the prediction of testosterone effects. A situation with chemicals exerting opposing effects, for which the models could not be applied, was identified. In addition, the data indicate that in non-potency adjusted mixtures the effects cannot always be accounted for by single chemicals.",

A wide variety of markers have been used to assess insect population dynamics, dispersal, territoriality, feeding behavior, trophic-level interactions, and other ecological interactions. The ideal marker should persist without inhibiting the insect’s “normal” biology. Furthermore, the marker should be environmentally safe, cost–effective, and easy to use. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge regarding insect marking, document the advantages and limitations of each marking technique, and discuss advances made in marking insects over the past decade.",

            "abstract": "Few studies have examined the exposure of small streams ($<$ 30 km2 catchment size) to agriculturally used pesticides, compared to large rivers. A total of 105 sites in 103 small agricultural streams were investigated for 76 pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides) and 32 pesticide metabolites in spring and summer over two years (2018 and 2019) during dry weather and rainfall using event-driven sampling. The median total con­ centration of the 76 pesticides was 0.18 µg/L, with 9 pesticides per sample on average (n = 815). This is significantly higher than monitoring data for larger streams, reflecting the close proximity to agricultural fields and the limited dilution by non-agricultural waters. The frequency of detection of all pesticides correlated with sales quantity and half-lives in water. Terbuthylazine, MCPA, boscalid, and tebuconazole showed the highest median concentrations. The median of the total concentration of the 32 metabolites exceeded the pesticide concentration by more than an order of magnitude. During dry weather, the median total concentration of the 76 pesticides was 0.07 µg/L, with 5 pesticides per sample on average. Rainfall events increased the median total pesticide concentration by a factor of 10 (to 0.7 µg/L), and the average number of pesticides per sample to 14 (with up to 41 in single samples). The concentration increase was particularly strong for 2,4-D, MCPA, terbu­ thylazine, and nicosulfuron (75 percentile). Metabolite concentrations were generally less responsive to rainfall, except for those of terbuthylazine, flufenacet, metamitron, and prothioconazole. The frequent and widespread exceedance of the regulatory acceptable concentrations (RAC) of the 76 pesticides during both, dry weather and rainfall, suggests that current plant protection product authorization and risk mitigation methods are not suf­ ficient to protect small streams.",

            "abstract": "Despite the potential for rapid evolution, stasis is commonly observed over geological timescales – the so-called “paradox of stasis.” This paradox would be resolved if stabilizing selection were common, but stabilizing selection is infrequently detected in natural populations. We hypothesize a simple solution to this apparent disconnect: stabilizing selection is hard to detect empirically once populations have adapted to a fitness peak. To test this hypothesis, we developed an individual-based model of a population evolving under an invariant stabilizing fitness function. Stabilizing selection on the population was infrequently detected in an “empirical” sampling protocol, because (1) trait variation was low relative to the fitness peak breadth; (2) non-selective deaths masked selection; (3) populations wandered around the fitness peak; and (4) sample sizes were typically too small. Moreover, the addition of negative frequency-dependent selection further hindered detection by flattening or even dimpling the fitness peak, a phenomenon we term “squashed stabilizing selection”. Our model demonstrates that stabilizing selection provides a plausible resolution to the paradox of stasis despite its infrequent detection in nature. The key reason is that selection “erases its traces”: once populations have adapted to a fitness peak, they are no longer expected to exhibit detectable stabilizing selection.",

            "abstract": "Epoxiconazole is among the most widely applied pesticides worldwide. The increased use of these products could cause toxic effects on human health which are mainly associated with its residues in food or occupational exposure in agriculture. The brain is the principal target of lipophilic compounds exposure, while the data of brain injury induced by Epoxiconazole remains unclear. The purpose of our investigation was to assess the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the epoxiconazole in rat Pheochromocytoma (PC 12). We found that epox­ iconazole could reduce the viability and proliferation of PC12 cells, induce the DNA damage, nuclear conden­ sation, cytoskeleton network disruption and enhance the apoptotic cell death. Intracellular biochemical assay proved that EPX induces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and activates caspase-3. Indeed, EPX instigated ROS generation in neuronal cells, which is accompanied by an increase of lipid peroxidation as confirmed by the high levels of MDA. Interestingly, Pre-treatment of PC12 cells with the ROS scavenger Nacetylcysteine mitigated EPX-provoked DNA fragmentation and enhancement of apoptosis. Our results demon­ strate that the genotoxic and cytotoxic outcomes of EPX are mediated through a ROS-dependent pathway in PC12 cells.",

            "abstract": "Fast evolutionary changes are common in natural populations, though episodes of rapid evolution do not generally last for long and are typically associated with changing environments. During such periods, evolutionary dynamics may influence ecological population dynamics and vice versa. This review is concerned with spatial eco-evolutionary dynamics with a focus on the occurrence of species in marginal habitats and on metapopulations inhabiting heterogeneous environments. Dispersal and gene flow are key processes in both cases, linking demographic and evolutionary dynamics to each other, facilitating but also constraining the expansion of the current niche and the geographical range of species and determining the spatial scale and pattern of adaptation in heterogeneous environments. An eco-evolutionary metapopulation model helps explain the contrasting responses of species to habitat loss and fragmentation. Eco-evolutionary dynamics may facilitate the persistence of species in changing environments, but typically the evolutionary response only partially compensates for the negative ecological consequences of adverse environmental changes.",

The response ratio (the ratio of mean outcome in the experimental group to that in the control group) and closely related measures of proportionate change are often used as measures of effect magnitude in ecology. Using these metrics for meta-analysis requires knowledge of their statistical properties, but these have not been previously derived. We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio, discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology, and demonstrate how to use it in meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of response-ratio data is illustrated using experimental data on the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on plant biomass responses.",

            "abstract": "This special issue of Genetica brings together a diverse collection of contributions that examine evolution within and among populations (i.e., microevolution), and the role that microevolution plays in the formation of new species and morphological forms (i.e., macroevolution). Many of the papers present evidence of microevolution occurring over contemporary time frames, further validating the near ubiquity of ongoing evolution in the world around us. Several synthetic reviews of empirical work help to define the conditions under which microevolution is or is not likely to occur. Some of the studies speak directly to current controversies in evolutionary biology, such as the relative roles of determinism and contingency, and the nature of the relationship between microevolution and macroevolution. In general, microevolution seems driven largely by deterministic mechanisms, particularly natural selection, but contingency plays a role in (1) determining whether or not suitable conditions are present for evolution to proceed, and (2) guiding the precise manner by which evolution proceeds. Several theoretical treatments and empirical reviews confirm previous research in showing that microevolutionary processes are at least capable of generating macroevolutionary trends. Macroevolution may indeed reflect microevolution writ large but the pattern by which it arises is perhaps best characterized as microevolution writ in fits and starts.",

            "abstract": "Human activities can expose populations to dramatic environmental perturbations, which may then precipitate adaptive phenotypic change. We ask whether or not phenotypic changes associated with human-disturbed (anthropogenic) contexts are greater than those associated with more “natural” contexts. Our meta-analysis is based on more than 3000 rates of phenotypic change in 68 “systems”, each representing a given species in a particular geographical area. We find that rates of phenotypic change are greater in anthropogenic contexts than in natural contexts. This difference may be influenced by phenotypic plasticity — because it was evident for studies of wild-caught individuals (which integrate both genetic and plastic effects) but not for common-garden or quantitative genetic studies (which minimize plastic effects). We also find that phenotypic changes in response to disturbance can be remarkably abrupt, perhaps again because of plasticity. In short, humans are an important agent driving phenotypic change in contemporary populations. Although these changes sometimes have a genetic basis, our analyses suggest a particularly important contribution from phenotypic plasticity.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to predict the dependence on temperature and food density of effects of Cu on the litter consumption by the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus, using a dynamic energy budget model (DEB-model). As a measure of the effects of Cu on food consumption, EC50s (soil concentrations causing 50% reduction compared to a control) were predicted with the total amount of consumed litter from birth to the age of 3 years as an endpoint, for a sandy loam soil. All possible combinations of six temperature and six food density scenarios were used. Temperature was kept constant at 10, 15 and 20 ◦C or fluctuated around these temperatures with an amplitude of 5 ◦C. The effect of food density on food consumption was represented by a dimensionless functional response, varying between 0 (no food) and 1 (unlimited food), which was kept constant at 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 or fluctuated around these values with an amplitude of 0.25. Assuming that the DEB-model is able to describe litter consumption by L. rubellus, model simulations predicted EC50s between 212 and 284 mg Cu/kg, depending on the scenarios used for the temperature and functional response. Increasing the temperature for constant temperature scenarios or the average temperature for fluctuating temperature scenarios from 10 to 20 ◦C resulted in a decrease of EC50s of 28–34 mg Cu/kg, depending on the scenario for the functional response. Comparing EC50s for temperature regimes with a seasonal fluctuation to those with a constant temperature, showed that fluctuation resulted in a small decrease of EC50s (1–7 mg Cu/kg), independent of the functional response scenario. If the functional response did not fluctuate, increasing its value had a negligible effect on EC50s for all temperature scenarios. However, if the functional response fluctuated, increasing its average value from 0.25 to 0.75 resulted in a decrease of EC50s of 29–53 mg Cu/kg, depending on the temperature scenario. The effect of fluctuation of the functional response itself resulted in an increase of EC50s between 6 and 62 mg Cu/kg compared to constant scenarios, depending on the average functional response and the temperature. Because not enough data could be found in the literature to reliably estimate all parameter values, effects of temperature and food density on EC50s as predicted by the DEB-model should be interpreted carefully. Keeping this in mind, this study shows that temperature and food density can affect the sensitivity of litter consumption by earthworms to Cu pollution and should be taken into account in the risk assessment of heavy metal pollution for the functioning of detritivores.",

            "abstract": "1. Ecotoxicology seeks to blend the disciplines of toxicology and ecology to provide a means of assessing the risk that natural populations of organisms are exposed to when confronted by an environmental stress, such as a pollutant. The LC 50 of a compound is usually used to assess this risk with little or no consideration of the importance of the variation about the mean. 2. Several populations of the Rice Weevil, Sitophilus oryzae , were examined that had been bred on toxic (Yellow Split‐pea) or non‐toxic (Wheat) foodstuffs, or transferred between the two. The goal was to establish the effect of stress on the levels of activity of two detoxification enzyme systems, esterases and glutathione‐ S ‐transferases, and the variation about the mean enzyme activity. 3. Populations kept on their original foodstuffs showed similar levels of enzyme activity irrespective of whether they bred on toxic or non‐toxic foods. When transferred to a novel food stuff there was a small increase in enzyme activity, perhaps reflecting induction, but transfer to a more toxic food did not produce a greater increase in activity than transfer to a non‐toxic food. 4. Populations on their original foodstuff showed similar levels of variation about the mean, but the variation about the mean increased considerably following transfer to a novel food. There was some evidence that this increase was greater when the transfer was to the more toxic food. 5. The increase in variation following transfer was largely due to a small number of individuals showing particularly high levels of enzyme activity. The consequence of the generation of this type of distribution in response to an environmental stress is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The effects of decreasing soil water potential on cocoon production, cocoon development and growth of juveniles were investigated in the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa. The earthworms were subjected to water potentials between 22 and ca. 2300 kPa, using two soil types with various wetness. The duration of the drought exposure was 14 days, whereafter the earthworms were returned to ideal moisture conditions. Cocoon production was negatively affected when the water potential was lower than 212 kPa, and below 240 kPa cocoon production was completely arrested. The negative effect on cocoon production persisted for at least 2 weeks after the worms were moved back to soil with optimal moisture conditions. For those worms that were exposed to the most severe drought level, 2330 kPa, cocoon production was still signiÆcantly impaired two months after drought exposure. Juvenile growth was sensitive to decreasing water potential. Even at 26 kPa the growth of juveniles was signiÆcantly lower than in controls and at ca. 220 kPa there was no growth at all. Cocoon development was less sensitive to water potential than growth and cocoon production. Thus, development seemed not to be affected by a 14 day exposure at water potentials above ca. 2700 kPa, whereas at higher levels there was an increasing effect. When cocoons were exposed to ca. 23 MPa the development was immediately arrested. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Therefore, we collected toxicity data from rats to assess environmental and human health effects from exposures. The approximate lethal dose for both sexes was 5000 mg/kg. A 14-day toxicity study in rats was conducted with 4A2NT in the feed at concentrations of 0, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 ppm. Based on a 14-day oral dose range toxicity study with 4A2NT in the feed, 2000 ppm was selected as highest concentration for a subsequent 90-day study. An oral 90-day subchronic toxicity study in rats was conducted with concentrations of 0, 500, 1000, or 2000 ppm of 4A2NT in the feed. The calculated consumed doses of 4A2NT in the feed were 0, 27, 52, or 115 mg/kg/d for males and 0, 32, 65, or 138 mg/kg/d for females. A no-observed adverse effect level could not be determined. The lowest observed adverse effect level was 27 mg/kg/d for males and 32 mg/kg/d for female rats based upon decreased body weight gain. The decreased body weight gain in male rats was the most sensitive adverse event observed in this study and was used to derive a benchmark dose (BMD). A BMD of 23.1 mg/kg/d and BMD with 10% effect level of 15.5 mg/kg/d were calculated for male rats, which were used to derive an oral reference dose (RfD). The human RfD of 1.26 μg/kg/d was derived using current United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.",

            "abstract": "Having recognized that variation around the population-level “Golden Mean” of labile traits contains biologically meaningful information, behavioural ecologists have focused increasingly on exploring the causes and consequences of individual variation in behaviour. These are exciting new directions for the field, assisted in no small part by the adoption of mixed-effects modelling techniques that enable the partitioning of among- and within-individual behavioural variation. It has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example, between a personality trait and other individual traits such as cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from these individual-level point estimates. We briefly summarize the problems with such statistical methods that are used regularly by behavioural ecologists, and highlight the robust solutions that exist within the mixed model framework, providing tutorials to aid in their implementation.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms take up chemicals from both soil pore water and food, but the quantitative contribution of each route is unclear. In this paper, a model is presented for the accumulation of organic chemicals in earthworms, including a compartment for the gut contents. A Monte Carlo screening method is used to calibrate the model simultaneously to four experimental data sets for hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in the compost worm (Eisenia andrei). The calibration procedure shows that the dominant route of exposure is across the gut wall. Nevertheless, predicted body residues of HCB are generally no more than 20% higher than the estimate based on equilibrium partitioning (EP), independent of the uncertainties in all of the model parameters. The deviation from EP is mainly related to the digestive efficiency of the earthworm. Body residues are not expected to exceed the EP estimate by more than 50% for other chemicals or other earthworm species. The model is particularly useful when the organism’s food source is specifically contaminated and EP cannot be applied.",

            "abstract": "To understand the life cycle of an organism, it is important to understand the physiological processes that govern growth and reproduction. In this paper, we re-analyse a life-cycle data set for the earthworm Eisenia veneta, using a process-based model. The data set comprises measurements of body size and cocoon production over 200 days, at two temperatures (15–25 8C) and two densities (five and 10 worms per container, but with the same worm:soil weight ratio). The model consists of a set of simple equations, derived from Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. The dynamics of growth and reproduction are simultaneously described by the model, using very few parameters (five parameters for four curves). This supports the use of this model for efficient analysis of earthworm life-cycle data, and to interpret the effects of stressors. However, there was considerable inter-individual variation in the response, hampering the interpretation of the temperature and density effects. A temperature increase corresponded to an increase in the rate constants for growth and reproduction (with the same factor), without affecting the other parameters, as expected from DEB theory. Changing the earthworm density hardly affected the growth curves, but had an unexpected effect on reproduction: at higher densities, the worms start to produce cocoons at a larger body size and the maximum reproduction rate was lower. This study confirms the use of DEB as a reference model for earthworms, and using this model, we can recognise that temperature has a predictable effect on the life cycle of E. veneta. Furthermore, this analysis reveals that the effects of density are less clear and may involve a change in energy allocation that requires further study.",

However, toxicity is usually assessed in short-term experiments with individuals. Modelling based on dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory aids the extraction of mechanistic information from the data, which in turn supports educated extrapolation to the population level. To illustrate the use of DEB models in this extrapolation, we analyse a dataset for life cycle toxicity of copper in the earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra. We compare four approaches for the analysis of the toxicity data: no model, a simple DEB model without reserves and maturation (the Kooijman–Metz formulation), a more complex one with static reserves and simplified maturation (as used in the DEBtox software) and a full-scale DEB model (DEB3) with explicit calculation of reserves and maturation. For the population prediction, we compare two simple demographic approaches (discrete time matrix model and continuous time Euler–Lotka equation). In our case, the difference between DEB approaches and population models turned out to be small. However, differences between DEB models increased when extrapolating to more field-relevant conditions. The DEB3 model allows for a completely consistent assessment of toxic effects and therefore greater confidence in extrapolating, but poses greater demands on the available data.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the life cycle of individual animals, and how it responds to stress, requires a model that causally links life-history traits (feeding, growth, development and reproduction). Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory offers a powerful and formalised framework for building process-based models for organism life cycles. However, it takes some serious investment to understand the resulting equations and to implement them into software, and a substantial amount of data to parameterise. For many practical applications, there is therefore a need for further simplification. Here, we present a simple and transparent model that fully specifies the life cycle of an (invertebrate) animal, applies a strict mass balance, and has direct access to the primary parameters that determine the metabolic processes. We derive our “DEBkiss” in a formalised manner, starting from an explicit formulation of the simplifying assumptions. The presented model can serve as a teaching tool and a smooth introduction into the much richer world of DEB theory. Furthermore, the model may prove useful as a building block for individualbased population modelling (where simplicity of the blocks is essential), and for the analysis of toxicity data (where ease of model verification and parameterisation is crucial). The model is illustrated using a fit on growth and reproduction data for the pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis) at three food levels, and subsequent predictions for embryonic growth and respiration (oxygen use), and weight loss on starvation, for the same species.",

            "abstract": "The individuals of a species are not equal. These differences frustrate experimental biologists and ecotoxicologists who wish to study the response of a species (in general) to a treatment. In the analysis of data, differences between model predictions and observations on individual animals are usually treated as random measurement error around the true response. These deviations, however, are mainly caused by real differences between the individuals (e.g., differences in physiology and in initial conditions). Understanding these intraspecies differences, and accounting for them in the data analysis, will improve our understanding of the response to the treatment we are investigating and allow for a more powerful, less biased, statistical analysis. Here, I explore a basic scheme for statistical inference to estimate parameters governing stress that allows individuals to differ in their basic physiology. This scheme is illustrated using a simple toxicokinetic−toxicodynamic model and a data set for growth of the springtail Folsomia candida exposed to cadmium in food. This article should be seen as proof of concept; a first step in bringing more realism into the statistical inference for processbased models in ecotoxicology.",

For sub-lethal effects on life-history traits, dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides a solid basis for TKTD modelling. Various DEB-based TKTD models have been presented, ranging from complex and comprehensive to simple and reduced. Here we present a complete and up-to-date model formulation at the complex end of the range. The basic part of the model, governing the life cycle of the species without toxicant stress, is formed by the standard DEB animal model. This part can directly use the species-specific model parameters from the add-my-pet (AmP) library. Additionally, we cover one extension of the standard model with metabolic acceleration for some time after birth (the abj-model). The basic DEB model is augmented by a TKTD model that explicitly considers damage as driving force for the toxic effects, and which considers various feedbacks from life-history traits to damage dynamics (e.g., dilution by growth). Several choices are needed in this linkage, which are made explicit. A Matlab-based toolbox is presented to support the model analyses, which is illustrated with a case study for the springtail Folsomia candida exposed to chlorpyrifos in food.",

            "abstract": "Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been used for passive equilibrium sampling in numerous abiotic environmental matrices. Recently, this approach was extended to lipid-rich tissue. This work investigated the possibilities and limitations of using PDMS thin-film extraction for in tissue equilibrium sampling in fish species of varying lipid content. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used as model lipophilic organic pollutants. PDMS thin-films were inserted in intact fish tissue for differing time periods (1 h up to 1 week). The thin-films were then solvent-extracted and the extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Whether equilibrium had been established was investigated either by using PDMS thin-films of multiple thicknesses (140–620 lm) or by assessing kinetics by means of time series. Equilibration was found to be rapid (i.e. in the range of hours) in lipid-rich fish whereas equilibrium was not achieved within one week in tissues with low or medium lipid content (i.e. up to 2% lipids). Regarding lipid-rich fish, the newly developed method was found to be sufficiently sensitive to determine equilibrium partitioning concentrations of PCBs in lipids of samples from the Baltic Sea, and it is a promising approach for any kind of fatty tissue.",

            "abstract": "Background: Humans and wildlife are continuously exposed to chemical mixtures. These mixtures vary in composition but typically contain hundreds of micropollutants at low concentrations. As it is not feasible to measure the toxicity of all possibly occurring mixtures, there is a need to predict mixture toxicity. Two models, Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA), have been applied to estimate mixture toxicity. Here, we compared measured with predicted toxicity of nine mixtures designed from 15 environmentally relevant substances in zebrafish embryos to investigate the usability of these models for predicting phenotypic effects in a whole organism short term acute assay. Results: In total, we compared 177 toxicity values derived from 31 exposure scenarios with their predicted counterparts. Our results show that mixture toxicity was either correctly estimated (86%) by the prediction window, the concentration-effect space that is spanned between both models, or was underestimated with both models (14%). The CA model correctly predicted the measured mixture toxicity in 100% of cases when a prediction deviation factor of 2.5 was allowed. However, prediction accuracy of mixture toxicity prediction was dependent on exposure duration and mixture potency. The CA model showed highest prediction quality for long-term exposure with highly potent mixtures, respectively, whereas IA proved to be more accurate for short-term exposure with less potent mixtures. Obtained mixture concentration–response curves were steep and indicated the occurrence of remarkable combined effects as mixture constituents were applied at concentrations below their respective individual effect threshold in 90% of all investigated cases. Conclusions: Experimental factors, such as exposure duration or mixture potency, influence the prediction accuracy of both inspected models. The CA model showed highest prediction accuracy even for a set of diverse mixtures and various exposure conditions. However, the prediction window served as the most robust predicator to estimate mixture toxicity. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering mixture toxicity in risk assessment schemes and give guidance for future experiment design regarding mixture toxicity investigations.",

The quantitative AOP (qAOP) advances AOP by integrating quantitative data and mathematical modeling, thereby providing a more precise comprehension of relationships between molecular initiating events, key events, and adverse outcomes. This review critically examines three primary methodologies: systems toxicology, regression modeling, and Bayesian network modeling, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and specific data requirements within toxicology. Through an analysis of current methodologies and challenges, this review emphasizes the integration of experimental and computational approaches to elucidate key event relationships and proposes strategies for overcoming limitations through standardized protocols and advanced computational tools. By outlining future research directions and the potential of qAOPs to transform chemical risk assessment, this review aims to contribute to the advancement of regulatory science and the protection of public health and the environment.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides a sophisticated, mechanistic framework for understanding the full life cycles of individuals within a complex environment. By relating environmental conditions, notably food availability, to individual life histories, DEB theory makes it possible, in principle, to make predictions for individuals and populations that extend beyond the conditions used to develop and parameterize the model. However, for this approach to reach its full potential as a predictive theory, we need methods of similar sophistication to link unobservable modeled quantities to data and to infer model parameters. Here, we develop such a method in a Bayesian framework. We offer a rigorous methodology for modeling the link between underlying unobservable states and observable quantities and for parameter inference. The methodology is introduced and its effectiveness as applied to data simulated under various dynamic food regimes is demonstrated. We also examine how parameter estimates can be affected by misspecification of the food model, specifically by assuming a constant food level when the true underlying dynamics are variable. This is critical as many published applications of DEB theory assume constant food when estimating parameter values. The effectiveness of the approach for data on the growth and reproduction of the water flea Daphnia is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "There is little consensus on how agriculture will meet future food demands sustainably. Soils and their biota play a crucial role by mediating ecosystem services that support agricultural productivity. However, a multitude of site-specific environmental factors and management practices interact to affect the ability of soil biota to perform vital functions, confounding the interpretation of results from experimental approaches. Insights can be gained through models, which integrate the physiological, biological and ecological mechanisms underpinning soil functions. We present a powerful modelling approach for predicting how agricultural management practices (pesticide applications and tillage) affect soil functioning through earthworm populations. By combining energy budgets and individual-based simulation models, and integrating key behavioural and ecological drivers, we accurately predict population responses to pesticide applications in different climatic conditions. We use the model to analyse the ecological consequences of different weed management practices. Our results demonstrate that an important link between agricultural management (herbicide applications and zero, reduced and conventional tillage) and earthworms is the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM). We show how zero and reduced tillage practices can increase crop yields while preserving natural ecosystem functions. This demonstrates how management practices which aim to sustain agricultural productivity should account for their effects on earthworm populations, as their proliferation stimulates agricultural productivity. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that conventional tillage practices have longer term effects on soil biota than pesticide control, if the pesticide has a short dissipation time. The risk of earthworm populations becoming exposed to toxic pesticides will be reduced under dry soil conditions. Similarly, an increase in soil organic matter could increase the recovery rate of earthworm populations. However, effects are not necessarily additive and the impact of different management practices on earthworms depends on their timing and the prevailing environmental conditions. Our model can be used to determine which combinations of crop management practices and climatic conditions pose least overall risk to earthworm populations. Linking our model mechanistically to crop yield models would aid the optimization of crop management systems by exploring the trade-off between different ecosystem services.",

Investigating whether such data deviate from the reference models of concentration addition and/or independent action to identify overall synergism or antagonism is becoming routine. However, recent data show that more complex deviation patterns, such as dose ratio—dependent deviation and dose level—dependent deviation, need to be addressed. For concentration addition, methods to detect such deviation patterns exist, but they are stand-alone methods developed separately in literature, and conclusions derived from these analyses are therefore difficult to compare. For independent action, hardly any methods to detect such deviations from this reference model exist. This paper describes how these well-established mixture toxicity principles have been incorporated in a coherent data analysis procedure enabling detection and quantification of dose level—and dose ratio—specific synergism or antagonism from both the concentration addition and the independent action models. Significance testing of which deviation pattern describes the data best is carried out through maximum likelihood analysis. This analysis procedure is demonstrated through various data sets, and its applicability and limitations in mixture research are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Cryptic species are rarely considered in ecotoxicology, resulting in misleading outcomes when using a single morphospecies that encompasses multiple cryptic species. This oversight contributes to the lack of reproducibility in ecotoxicological experiments and promotes unreliable extrapolations. The important question of ecological differentiation and the sensitivity of cryptic species is rarely tackled, leaving a substantial knowledge gap regarding the vulnerability of individual cryptic species within species complexes. In times of agricultural intensification and the frequent use of pesticides, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the vulnerability of species complexes and possible differences in adaptive processes. We used the cryptic species complex of the aquatic amphipod Gammarus roeselii, which comprises at least 13 genetic mtDNA lineages and spans from small-scale endemic lineages in Greece to a large-scale widely distributed lineage in central Europe. We exposed eleven populations belonging to four lineages to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid in an acute toxicity assay. We recorded various environmental variables in each habitat to assess the potential pre-exposure of the populations to contaminants. Our results showed that the populations differed up to 4-fold in their tolerances. The lineage identity had a rather minor influence, suggesting that the cryptic species complex G. roeselii does not differ significantly in tolerance to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid. However, the observed population differentiation implies that recent pre-exposure to thiacloprid (or similar substances) or general habitat contamination has triggered adaptive processes. Though, the extent to which these mechanisms are equally triggered in all lineages needs to be addressed in the future. Our study provides two key findings: Firstly, it shows that observed phylogenetic differences within the G. roeselii species complex did not reveal differences in thiacloprid tolerance. Second, it confirms that differentiation occurs at the population level, highlighting that susceptibility to toxicants is population-dependent. The population-specific differences were within the range of accepted intraspecific variability from a regulatory standpoint. From an evolutionary-ecological perspective, it remains intriguing to observe how persistent stresses will continue to influence tolerance and whether different populations are on distinct pathways of adaptation. Given that the potential selection process has only lasted a relatively short number of generations, it is crucial to monitor these populations in the future, as even brief exposure periods significantly impact evolutionary responses.",

We introduce a practical and computationally efficient sensitivity analysis approach using importance sampling to estimate properties of posteriors resulting from power-scaling the prior or likelihood. On this basis, we suggest a diagnostic that can indicate the presence of prior-data conflict or likelihood noninformativity and discuss limitations to this power-scaling approach. The approach can be easily included in Bayesian workflows with minimal effort by the model builder and we present an implementation in our new R package priorsense. We further demonstrate the workflow on case studies of real data using models varying in complexity from simple linear models to Gaussian process models.",

            "abstract": "Unlocking the puzzle of how animals behave and how they interact with their environments is impossible without understanding the physiological processes that determine their use of food resources. But long overdue is a user-friendly introduction to the subject that systematically bridges the gap between physiology and ecology. Ecologists–for whom such knowledge can help clarify the consequences of global climate change, the biodiversity crisis, and pollution–often find themselves wading through an unwieldy, technically top-heavy literature. Here, William Karasov and Carlos Martínez del Rio present the first accessible and authoritative one-volume overview of the physiological and biochemical principles that shape how animals procure energy and nutrients and free themselves of toxins–and how this relates to broader ecological phenomena. After introducing primary concepts, the authors review the chemical ecology of food, and then discuss how animals digest and process food. Their broad view includes symbioses and extends even to ecosystem phenomena such as ecological stochiometry and toxicant biomagnification. They introduce key methods and illustrate principles with wide-ranging vertebrate and invertebrate examples. Uniquely, they also link the physiological mechanisms of resource use with ecological phenomena such as how and why animals choose what they eat and how they participate in the exchange of energy and materials in their biological communities. Thoroughly up-to-date and pointing the way to future research, Physiological Ecology is an essential new source for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students-and an ideal synthesis for professionals.

We discuss the effects of earthworms in the context of Natural Capital and Ecosystem Service frameworks and suggest that the broad functional groups of earthworms (Epigeic, Anecic and Endogeic) can be used as Ecosystem Service Provider units. Differences in the relative influence of these functional groups on key soil processes demonstrates their potential utility for monitoring and valuing soil Ecosystem Services under different land management options and highlights that management for particular functional groups could be used to promote specific Ecosystem Services.",

            "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity can be broadly defined as the ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype when exposed to different environments, as the modification of developmental events by the environment, or as the ability of an individual organism to alter its phenotype in response to changes in environmental conditions. Not surprisingly, the study of phenotypic plasticity is innately interdisciplinary and encompasses aspects of behavior, development, ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics, and multiple physiological systems at various levels of biological organization. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, phenotypic plasticity may be a powerful means of adaptation and dramatic examples of phenotypic plasticity include predator avoidance, insect wing polymorphisms, the timing of metamorphosis in amphibians, osmoregulation in fishes, and alternative reproductive tactics in male vertebrates. From a human health perspective, documented examples of plasticity most commonly include the results of exercise, training, and/or dieting on human morphology and physiology. Regardless of the discipline, phenotypic plasticity has increasingly become the target of a plethora of investigations with the methodological approaches utilized ranging from the molecular to whole organsimal. In this article, we provide a brief historical outlook on phenotypic plasticity; examine its potential adaptive significance; emphasize recent molecular approaches that provide novel insight into underlying mechanisms, and highlight examples in fishes and insects. Finally, we highlight examples of phenotypic plasticity from a human health perspective and underscore the use of mouse models as a powerful tool in understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypic plasticity.

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of Industrial Melanism has occurred as an indirect effect of a recent environmental change: the pollution of the air from the combustion of coal, coke, and oil. Probably no other previous cataclysm in the history of the World has produced such immediate and widespread effects upon natural history. In the past, the eruptions of volcanoes must have altered environments but usually these were of limited extent. By contrast, air pollution by smoke has a multitude of diverse origins which have continually poured out effluvia into the atmosphere, both by day and by night, for more than 200 years. The phenomenon of Industrial Melanism has frequently in the past been considered an exceptional event. This is entirely incorrect. It reflects but one of a number of situations which, in the Lepidoptera, demand black coloration for survival. What is so striking is the speed with which black forms have replaced the previous light-colored populations. Moreover, in Britain alone, there are over one hundred species of moths in widely diverse genera which manifest Industrial Melanism. Similar situations are now being recorded around all industrial areas in the Northern Hemisphere; wherever, in fact, they have been looked for. Industrial Melanism occurs also, but rarely, amongst the Arachnida and the Coleoptera.",

            "abstract": "Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is used as a general reference toxicant in aquatic toxicity testing, but relatively little is known regarding the effects of water quality parameters on K2Cr2O7 toxicity to Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity of K2Cr2O7 to D. magna was comparatively examined in one very hard (M4 medium for D. magna assay), four hard, one moderately hard and one soft dilution water samples. The 48-h EC50 (50% effective concentration) of K2Cr2O7 to D. magna was reproducible (coefficient of variation [CV]: 13%) in tests using the same dilution water sample, but reproducibility was poor (CV: 62%) in tests using seven different dilution water samples. The observed 48-h EC50 value increased with increasing water hardness (28e250 mg CaCO3/L) and Naþ concentration (4.3e19.7 mg Na/L). The effect of Ca2þ and Mg2þ on K2Cr2O7 toxicity was equivalent in terms of molar concentration. The 48-h EC50 for K2Cr2O7 was determined according to OECD TG 202 by six contract laboratories using M4 medium and were shown to be reproducible (CV: 15%), indicating that the toxicity level can be determined with high accuracy if holding and dilution water samples are standardized. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the 48-h EC50 was strongly correlated (r2 ¼ 0.927) with the Ca2þ, Mg2þ, Naþ concentration, and alkalinity of the dilution water samples. Detailed monitoring of water quality characteristics thus facilitates intra- and inter-laboratory comparisons of toxicity data and enables predictions of changes in the susceptibility of test animals.",

This strategy seems to work well for class projects in producing papers that ultimately get published, helping to professionalize students into the discipline, and teaching the scientific norms of the free exchange of academic information. I begin by briefly revisiting the prominent debate on replication our discipline had a decade ago and some of the progress made in data sharing since.My deepest appreciation goes, in addition to my students, to the numerous scholars who have cheerfully, and in some cases repeatedly, responded to my students’ queries over many years. Thanks also to the National Institutes of Aging (P01 AG17625-01) and the National Science Foundation (SES-0318275, IIS-9874747) for research support.",

            "abstract": "Widely used conazole antifungals were tested for endocrine disruptive effects using a panel of in vitro assays. They all showed endocrine disrupting potential and ability to act via several different mechanisms. Overall the imidazoles (econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, prochloraz) were more potent than the triazoles (epoxiconazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole). The critical mechanism seems to be disturbance of steroid biosynthesis. In the H295R cell assay, the conazoles decreased the formation of estradiol and testosterone, and increased the concentration of progesterone, indicating inhibition of enzymes involved in the conversion of progesterone to testosterone. Prochloraz was most potent followed by econazole ∼ miconazole $>$ ketoconazole $>$ tebuconazole $>$ epoxiconazole $>$ propiconazole. In the MCF7 cell proliferation assay, the conazoles showed anti-estrogenic effect, including aromatase inhibition, since they inhibited the response induced by both 17␤-estradiol (miconazole $>$ econazole ∼ ketoconazole $>$ prochloraz $>$ tebuconazole $>$ epoxiconazole $>$ propiconazole) and testosterone (econazole $>$ miconazole $>$ prochloraz $>$ ketoconazole $>$ tebuconazole $>$ epoxiconazole $>$ propiconazole). The triazoles were antiandrogenic in an androgen receptor reporter gene assay (epoxiconazole ∼ tebuconazole $>$ propiconazole). This effect could not be evaluated for the pharmaceutical imidazoles due to cytotoxicity.",

            "abstract": "Chironomids have a number of characteristics that make them a useful group for investigating the impact of environmental and chemical stressors on their life cycle stages. It is crucial to first understand sensitivities to environmental factors and provide a basis for interpreting the results of toxicity tests. We focused on Chironomus riparius–one of the most studied species in aquatic toxicity tests—to understand the changes during the larval stage under conditions of food abundance and limitation. We developed a model based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, a framework to capture the entire life cycle of an individual under varying food and temperature conditions. Available information from this study and the literature pointed out that the first three larval instars are immature and the fourth larval instar is mature, during which the organism saves, in two phases, energy for essential processes occurring during the subsequent non-feeding stages. The model can successfully predict the observed prolonged fourth instar duration under food limitation, the times of life history events (e.g., pupation and emergence), and egg production. This model has the potential to be integrated with toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic models to study the effects of toxicants on a variety of biological traits.",

In applications of these models, life history parameters are usually treated as independent factors; however, they are actually strongly linked to each other. To interpret the effect of toxicants on life history parameters considering their interrelatedness the dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory can be applied. This theory is based on closed energy and mass balances and describes in a mechanistic way the acquisition and use of energy by individuals. In the present study we extended an existing combined DEB and matrix population model with an approach to take covariability of the DEB parameters into account. This was accomplished by estimating the joint posterior distribution of the parameters using Bayesian statistics. We used this model to extrapolate effects of copper in the common earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra to the population level.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we report on the influence of clay content and acidity of soil on growth and reproduction of the epigeic earthworm species Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffm.), which is common in most temperate soils and abundant in grasslands. Growth, cocoon production and survival of L. rubellus were tested in 12 Dutch soils which differed in soil properties. A matrix model was used to assess the population-level consequences of changes in growth and reproduction. Soil acidity had a strong negative effect on earthworm survival, and the maturation weight decreased with clay content. Individual weight gain in L. rubellus decreased with both acidity and clay content. The acidity of soils had a larger influence on population growth rate than the clay content. The acidity of the soil also changed the population composition towards younger age classes, whereas in soils rich in clay, the population composition did not change. The average individual weight of L. rubellus in clayey soils, however, was lower compared with that in soils low in clay, a result that agrees with literature data.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, the influence of earthworm density is assessed on the life-history parameters: growth, development, reproduction, and survival of Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffm.). Density ranges from two to nine earthworms in 1-l containers, corresponding to field densities of 300–1350 earthworms mÀ2. Earthworms were kept under optimal laboratory conditions, with a surplus of food. The results show that at high earthworm density, individual growth is retarded, maturation delayed and cocoon production decreased, even when food is optimal. The integration of these results into a Dynamic Energy Budget model suggests that the food intake of individual earthworms is lower at the higher tested densities. This lower food intake is most probably driven by competition for space at the higher densities. The lower food intake results in a lower intrinsic rate of population increase which is negative at the highest tested density.",

Currently this framework is not regularly applied in ecotoxicology given perceived complexity and data needs. However, even in the case of low data availability the DEB theory is already useful. In this paper we apply the DEB theory to evaluate the results in three previously published papers on the effects of PAHs on Arctic copepods. Since these results do not allow for a quantitative application we used DEB qualitatively. The ecotoxicological results were thereby set in a wider ecological context and we found a logical explanation for an unexpected decline in hatching success described in one of these papers. Moreover, the DEB evaluation helped to derive relevant ecological questions that can guide future experimental work on this subject.",

            "abstract": "The degree of biological variability within a population is an important factor for its ecological success. Yet, individual-based population models (IBMs) that utilize the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory as a mechanistic basis to simulate an individual’s life history, largely rely on rule-of-thumb estimates of inter-individual variability of their parameter values. In this study, we explored how data from previous life-history experiments with the copepod Nitocra spinipes could be used to make realistic estimates of variability in DEB parameter values for this species. We specifically investigated to which one of 12 possible parameters variability should be added, and what shape and scale its probability distribution should have, to most accurately reproduce the experimental data’s variation with model simulations. The best result was achieved by drawing the parameter “surface-areaspecific maximum assimilation rate” from a log-normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.15 or by drawing the maturity thresholds for birth and puberty (assuming proportionality between the two) from a lognormal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.40. In both cases, the model not only accurately reproduced the variation observed in development time data (which had been used in the fitting process) but also gave adequate predictions of the variation observed in brood size data (which had not been used for fitting). Although the findings of this study apply to one species only, the methods presented here are a proof of principle for how the question of intra-specific variability in a DEB model, for any species, can be addressed in a simple, yet purposeful manner.",

The theory presents simple mechanistic rules that describe the uptake and use of energy and nutrients and the consequences for physiological organization throughout an organism’s life cycle. All living organisms are covered in a single quantitative framework, the predictions of which are tested against a variety of experimental results at a range of levels of organisation. The theory explains many general observations, such as the body size scaling relationships of certain physiological traits, and provides a theoretical underpinning to the method of indirect calorimetry. In each case, the theory is developed in elementary mathematical terms, but a more detailed discussion of the methodological aspects of mathematical modelling is also included.",

            "abstract": "The dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory for metabolic organisation specifies quantitatively the processes of uptake of substrate by organisms and its use for the purpose of maintenance, growth, maturation and reproduction. It applies to all organisms. Animals are special because they typically feed on other organisms. This couples the uptake of the different required substrates, and their energetics can, therefore, be captured realistically with a single reserve and a single structure compartment in biomass. Effects of chemical compounds (e.g. toxicants) are included by linking parameter values to internal concentrations. This involves a toxico-kinetic module that is linked to the DEB, in terms of uptake, elimination and (metabolic) transformation of the compounds. The core of the kinetic module is the simple one-compartment model, but extensions and modifications are required to link it to DEBs. We discuss how these extensions relate to each other and how they can be organised in a coherent framework that deals with effects of compounds with varying concentrations and with mixtures of chemicals. For the one-compartment model and its extensions, as well as for the standard DEB model for individual organisms, theory is available for the co-variation of parameter values among different applications, which facilitates model applications and extrapolations.",

            "abstract": "During its 40 years of development, the assumptions of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory for metabolic organisation turned out hard to replace. To understand this, a reasoning is here presented for why its standard model has no alternatives with a comparable level of simplicity and will never have them. Energy and mass conservation rules are essential to quantify the eco-physiological development of an individual organism thermodynamically. These rules strongly constrain the mathematical modelling of this development. In combination with consistency with a small set of stylised empirical facts, the freedom of modelling the skeleton of the model is reduced to a single one: the standard DEB model. This skeleton can, however, be extended in many different ways to capture particular “details”. The key-message of this paper is that the more simple metabolic models become, the more constraining are consistency conditions.",

Studies in feral populations indicate the existence of a proactive and a reactive coping style. These coping styles seem to play a role in the population ecology of the species. Despite domestication, genetic selection and inbreeding, the same coping styles can, to some extent, also be observed in laboratory and farm animals. Coping styles are characterized by consistent behavioral and neuroendocrine characteristics, some of which seem to be causally linked to each other. Evidence is accumulating that the two coping styles might explain a differential vulnerability to stress mediated disease due to the differential adaptive value of the two coping styles and the accompanying neuroendocrine differentiation. ᭧ 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

            "abstract": "Evidence is mounting that chemicals can produce joint toxicity even when combined at levels that singly do not pose risks. Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) defined for single pollutants under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) do not protect from mixture risks, nor do they enable prioritization of management options. Despite some provisions for mixtures of specific groups of chemicals, the WFD is not fit for purpose for protecting against or managing the effects of coincidental mixtures of water-borne pollutants. The conceptual tools for conducting mixture risk assessment are available and ready for use in regulatory and risk assessment practice. Extension towards impact assessment using cumulative toxic unit and mixture toxic pressure analysis based on chemical monitoring data or modelling has been suggested by the SOLUTIONS project. Problems exist in the availability of the data necessary for mixture risk assessments. Mixture risk assessments cannot be conducted without essential input data about exposures to chemicals and their toxicity. If data are missing, mixture risk assessments will be biassed towards underestimating risks. The WFD itself is not intended to provide toxicity data. Data gaps can only be closed if proper feedback links between the WFD and other EU regulations for industrial chemicals (REACH), pesticides (PPPR), biocides (BPR) and pharmaceuticals are implemented. Changes of the WFD alone cannot meet these requirements. Effect-based monitoring programmes developed by SOLUTIONS should be implemented as they can capture the toxicity of complex mixtures and provide leads for new candidate chemicals that require attention in mixture risk assessment. Efforts of modelling pollutant levels and their anticipated mixture effects in surface water can also generate such leads. New pollutant prioritization schemes conceived by SOLUTIONS, applied in the context of site prioritization, will help to focus mixture risk assessments on those chemicals and sites that make substantial contributions to mixture risks.",

Toxicants can exhibit varying effects depending on the life stage of organisms, although standard toxicity tests typically focus on adult individuals. This study aimed to assess TEB’s potential adverse effects on the earthworm Dendrobaena veneta throughout its life cycle. Effects were evaluated by exposing cocoons to varying TEB concentrations, monitoring hatching, newly hatched juvenile mass, and growth to adulthood. A reproduction test assessed impacts on adults, offering insights into how these results compared with cocoon exposure findings. Results revealed that TEB delayed hatching at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg by 6, 8, and 15.5 days, respectively. Newly hatched juveniles exhibited a 15.96% (50 mg/kg) and 27.37% (100 mg/kg) reduction in body mass compared to controls, with no subsequent compensation during growth. Results from the reproduction tests showed no adverse effects on adult survival, but the effects are observed on juveniles, indicating a higher sensitivity of this developmental stage. While several adverse effects were observed, it is important to note that these occurred at concentrations exceeding recommended application rates. TEB appears safe for earthworms when used correctly, but the presence of multiple contaminants and stressors warrants consideration.",

            "abstract": "Water is polluted by increasing activities of population and the necessity to provide them with goods and services that use water as a vital resource. The contamination of water due to heavy metals (HMs) is a big concern for humankind; however, global studies related to this topic are scarce. Thus, the current review assesses the content of HMs in surface water bodies throughout the world from 1994 to 2019. To achieve this goal, multivariate analyses were applied in order to determine the possible sources of HMs. Among the analyzed HMs in a total of 147 publications, the average content of Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, As and Cd exceeded the permissible limits suggested by WHO and USEPA. The results of the heavy metal pollution index, evaluation index, the degree of contamination, water pollution and toxicity load showed that the examined water bodies are highly polluted by HMs. The results of median lethal toxicity index showed maximum toxicity in As, Co, Cr and Ni in the surface water bodies. Results of ingestion and dermal pathways for adults and children in the current analyzed review showed that As is the major contaminant. Moreover, Cr, Ni, As and Cd showed values that could be considered as a high risk for cancer generation via the ingestion pathway as compared to the dermal route. It is recommended that remediation techniques such as the introduction of aquatic phytoremediation plant species and adsorbents should be included in land management plans in order to reduce human risks.",

            "abstract": "The study of eco-evolutionary dynamics, that is of the intertwinning between ecological and evolutionary processes when they occur at comparable time scales, is of growing interest in the current context of global change. However, many eco-evolutionary studies overlook the role of interindividual interactions, which are hard to predict and yet central to selective values. Here, we aimed at putting forward models that simulate interindividual interactions in an eco-evolutionary framework: the demo-genetic agent-based models (DG-ABMs). Being demo-genetic, DG-ABMs consider the feedback loop between ecological and evolutionary processes. Being agent-based, DG-ABMs follow populations of interacting individuals with sets of traits that vary among the individuals. We argue that the ability of DG-ABMs to take into account the genetic heterogeneity—that affects individual decisions/traits related to local and instantaneous conditions—differentiates them from analytical models, another type of model largely used by evolutionary biologists to investigate eco-evolutionary feedback loops. Based on the review of studies employing DG-ABMs and explicitly or implicitly accounting for competitive, cooperative or reproductive interactions, we illustrate that DG-ABMs are particularly relevant for the exploration of fundamental, yet pressing, questions in evolutionary ecology across various levels of organization. By jointly modelling the effects of management practices and other eco-evolutionary processes on interindividual interactions and population dynamics, DG-ABMs are also effective prospective and decision support tools to evaluate the short- and long-term evolutionary costs and benefits of management strategies and to assess potential trade-offs. Finally, we provide a list of the recent practical advances of the ABM community that should facilitate the development of DG-ABMs.",

            "abstract": "The study of eco-­evolutionary dynamics, that is of the intertwinning between ecological and evolutionary processes when they occur at comparable time scales, is of growing interest in the current context of global change. However, many eco-­evolutionary studies overlook the role of interindividual interactions, which are hard to predict and yet central to selective values. Here, we aimed at putting forward models that simulate interindividual interactions in an eco-e­ volutionary framework: the demo-­ genetic agent-­based models (DG-­ABMs). Being demo-­genetic, DG-­ABMs consider the feedback loop between ecological and evolutionary processes. Being agent-­based, DG-­ABMs follow populations of interacting individuals with sets of traits that vary among the individuals. We argue that the ability of DG-­ABMs to take into account the genetic heterogeneity—­that affects individual decisions/traits related to local and instantaneous conditions—­differentiates them from analytical models, another type of model largely used by evolutionary biologists to investigate eco-­evolutionary feedback loops. Based on the review of studies employing DG-­ABMs and explicitly or implicitly accounting for competitive, cooperative or reproductive interactions, we illustrate that DG-­ABMs are particularly relevant for the exploration of fundamental, yet pressing, questions in evolutionary ecology across various levels of organization. By jointly modelling the effects of management practices and other eco-­evolutionary processes on interindividual interactions and population dynamics, DG-­ABMs are also effective prospective and decision support tools to evaluate the short-­and long-­term evolutionary costs and benefits of management strategies and to assess potential trade-­offs. Finally, we provide a list of the recent practical advances of the ABM community that should facilitate the development of DG-­ABMs.",

Toxicokinetic models -compartmentbased models, physiological-based models, and energetics-based models- are reviewed and the different mathematical formalisms compared. Additionally, the residue-based toxicity approach is reviewed. Coupling toxicokinetic models with tissue concentrations at which toxicity occurs offers a direct link between exposure and hazard. Basing hazard on tissue rather than environmental concentrations avoids the errors associated with accommodating multiple sources, pulsed exposures, and non-steady-state accumulation.",

It is inconceivable to study the effects of each compound on each species from each compartment, experimental studies being time consuming and cost prohibitive, and animal testing having to be avoided. Therefore, numerous models are developed to assess PPP ecotoxicological effects. Our objective was to provide an overview of the modeling approaches enabling the assessment of PPP effects (including biopesticides) on the biota. Six categories of models were inventoried: (Q)SAR, DR and TKTD, population, multi-species, landscape, and mixture models. They were developed for various species (terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates, primary producers, micro-organisms) belonging to diverse environmental compartments, to address different goals (e.g., species sensitivity or PPP bioaccumulation assessment, ecosystem services protection). Among them, mechanistic models are increasingly recognized by EFSA for PPP regulatory risk assessment but, to date, remain not considered in notified guidance documents. The strengths and limits of the reviewed models are discussed together with improvement avenues (multigenerational effects, multiple biotic and abiotic stressors). This review also underlines a lack of model testing by means of field data and of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Accurate and robust modeling of PPP effects and other stressors on living organisms, from their application in the field to their functional consequences on the ecosystems at different scales of time and space, would help going toward a more sustainable management of the environment.",

They participate actively in the interactions that develop in soil among physical, chemical and biological processes. We show that soils have all the attributes of self-organized systems as proposed by Perry (Trends Ecol. Evol. 10 (1995) 241) and detail the scales at which invertebrates operate and the different kinds of ecosystem engineering that they develop. This comprehensive analysis of invertebrate activities shows that they may be the best possible indicators of soil quality. They should also be considered as a resource that needs to be properly managed to enhance ecosystem services provided by agro-ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic energy budget models are the most ambitious of resource allocation models in biology, with many practitioners claiming that they apply to all organisms with only a few changes in parameters. Because of this generality, they make very broad predictions about how organisms function. There is extensive literature on the topic, but some of the broad implications nevertheless remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a careful derivation of the basic version of the model from elementary biological assumptions, and we identify some of the important implications of the model for growth, starvation, maturation, and reproduction.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms are regarded as one of the most suitable animals for testing the toxicity of chemicals in soils and have been adopted as standard organisms for ecotoxicological testing. In several guidelines concerning earthworm toxicity tests, Eisenia fetida/andrei (E. fetida/andrei) was chosen because it can be easily cultured in the laboratory and an extensive database on the effects of all classes of chemicals exists for this species. Acute and chronic toxicity tests have been used traditionally to assess the toxicity of contaminants, with mortality and changes in biomass, reproduction rates and behavioral responses representing endpoints. Moreover, the avoidance behavior test (AVT) using earthworm is under development and standardization, which records the ability of earthworms to choose or avoid a certain soil. Recent studies have shown that neutral red retention time (NRRT) has the potential for a rapid assessment of the toxic effects for earthworms of soils contaminated with heavy metals and metalloids. Toxicity is the apparent expression of the metal accumulation in earthworm body. The uptake, accumulation and elimination properties of metals by earthworm are the major part of toxicology, which is called toxicokinetics. Geochemical factors may have significant effects on metal transport or bioavailability. Prediction models for metal accumulation and toxicity in soils are being developed based on metal bioavailability. In this study, methodologies and research trends in earthworm toxicity are reviewed for understanding metal bioavailability. Toxicity prediction models are introduced for terrestrial environment and several studies are referred to understand the role of geochemistry in toxicology.",

This research was conducted to investigate the toxicity of Alginate/EUDRAGIT® S 100-enclosed chitosan–calcium phosphate-loaded Fe-bLf nanocapsules (NCs) by in vitro and in vivo assays. Brine shrimp lethality assay showed that the LC50 value of NCs was more than 1 mg/mL which indicated that NCs was not toxic to Brine shrimp. However, the LC50 values for the positive control potassium dichromate at 24 h is 64.15 μg/mL, which was demostrated the toxic effect against the brine shrimp. MTT cytotoxicity assay also revealed that NCs was not toxic against non-cancerous Vero cell line with IC50 values of 536 μg/mL. Genotoxicity studies by comet assay on Vero cells revealed that NCs exerted no significant genotoxic at 100 μg/mL without tail or shorter comet tail. Allium cepa root assay carried out at 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL for 24 h revealed that the NCs was destitute of significant genotoxic effect under experimental conditions. The results show that there is no significant difference (p $>$ 0.05) in mitotic index between the deionized water and NCs treated Allium cepa root tip cells. In conclusion, no toxicity was observed in NCs in this study. Therefore, nontoxic NCs has the good potential to develop as a therapeutic agent.",

Isomers of DNT were administered daily via oral gavage to male Sprague-Dawley rats for 14 days to determine the subacute toxicity of individual isomers of DNT. The 3,5-DNT isomer was the most toxic isomer, inducing weight loss and mortality within 3 days. Cyanosis and anemia were observed for all isomers. Exposure to 2,4-, 2,6-, and 3,5-DNT resulted in decreased testes mass and degenerative histopathological changes. Increased splenic mass was observed for 2,4-, 2,6-, and 2,5-DNT. Extramedullary hematopoiesis of the spleen was noted for all isomers, while lymphoid hyperplasia of the spleen was noted for all isomers except 2,5-DNT. Increased liver mass was observed for 2,3-DNT and 3,4-DNT. Hepatocellular lesions were observed for 2,6-DNT and 2,4-DNT. Neurotoxic effects were noted for 3,4-DNT, 2,4-DNT, and 3,5-DNT.",

            "abstract": "Chemicals considered as neuroactive (such as certain pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals) are among the largest groups of bioactive substances recently detected in European rivers. However, the determination of nervous-system-specific effects has been limited using in vitro tests or conventional end points including lethality. Thus, neurobehavioral tests using in vivo models (e.g., zebrafish embryo) have been proposed as complementary approaches. To investigate the specificity and sensitivity of a light−dark transition locomotor response (LMR) test in 4 to 5 days post fertilization zebrafish with respect to different modes of action (MoAs), we analyzed a set of 18 environmentally relevant compounds with various anticipated MoAs. We found that exposure-induced behavioral alterations were reproducible and dependent on concentration and time. Comparative and quantitative analyses of the obtained locomotor patterns revealed that behavioral effects were not restricted to compounds primarily known to target the nervous system. A clear distinction of MoAs based on locomotor patterns was not possible for most compounds. Furthermore, chemicals with an anticipated same MoA did not necessarily provoke similar behavioral phenotypes. Finally, we determined an increased sensitivity (≥10-fold) compared to observed mortality in the LMR assay for five of eight neuroactive chemicals as opposed to non-neuroactive compounds.",

This increase in resistance to the present antimicrobial agents led the researchers to find some alternative and more efficient drugs which can fight with the resistant microorganisms more effectively. Hence, in silico approach is used to design some novel drugs against various targets of microorganisms. For effective virtual screening of the drugs, there is a need to know about the chemical structure and properties of the antimicrobial agents. Therefore, we have prepared a comprehensive database as a platform for the researcher to search for possible lead molecules.

            "abstract": "Existing models for estimating pesticide bioconcentration in earthworms exhibit limited applicability across different chemicals, soils and species which restricts their potential as an alternative, intermediate tier for risk assessment. We used experimental data from uptake and elimination studies using three earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris, Aporrectodea caliginosa, Eisenia fetida), five pesticides (log Kow 1.69−6.63) and five soils (organic matter content = 0.972−39.9 wt %) to produce a first-order kinetic accumulation model. Model applicability was evaluated against a data set of 402 internal earthworm concentrations reported from the literature including chemical and soil properties outside the data range used to produce the model. Our models accurately predict body load using either porewater or bulk soil concentrations, with at least 93.5 and 84.3% of body load predictions within a factor of 10 and 5 of corresponding observed values, respectively. This suggests that there is no need to distinguish between porewater and soil exposure routes or to consider different uptake and elimination pathways when predicting earthworm bioconcentration. Our new model not only outperformed existing models in characterizing earthworm exposure to pesticides in soil, but it could also be integrated with models that account for earthworm movement and fluctuating soil pesticide concentrations due to degradation and transport.",

            "abstract": "The development of biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes is of major importance to meet the sustainable development challenges of our time. The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, has opened a new set of research and management opportunities to achieve this goal. On the one hand, this review summarizes UAV applications in agricultural landscapes, focusing on biodiversity conservation and agricultural land monitoring, based on a systematic review of the literature that resulted in 550 studies. Additionally, the review proposes how to integrate UAV research in these fields and point to new potential applications that may contribute to biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes. UAV-based imagery can be used to identify and monitor plants, floral resources and animals, facilitating the detection of quality habitats with high prediction power. Through vegetation indices derived from their sensors, UAVs can estimate biomass, monitor crop plant health and stress, detect pest or pathogen infestations, monitor soil fertility and target patches of high weed or invasive plant pressure, allowing precise management practices and reduced agrochemical input. Thereby, UAVs are helping to design biodiversity-friendly agricultural landscapes and to mitigate yield-biodiversity trade-offs. In conclusion, UAV applications have become a major means of biodiversity conservation and biodiversity-friendly management in agriculture, while latest developments, such as the miniaturization and decreasing costs of hyperspectral sensors, promise many new applications for the future.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Toxicants and other, non-chemical environmental stressors contribute to the global biodiversity crisis. Examples include the loss of bees and the reduction of aquatic biodiversity. Although non-compliance with regulations might be contributing, the widespread existence of these impacts suggests that for example the current approach of pesticide risk assessment fails to protect biodiversity when multiple stressors concurrently affect organisms. To quantify such multiple stress effects, we analysed all applicable aquatic studies and found that the presence of environmental stressors increases individual sensitivity to toxicants (pesticides, trace metals) by a factor of up to 100. To predict this dependence, we developed the “Stress Addition Model” (SAM). With the SAM, we assume that each individual has a general stress capacity towards all types of specific stress that should not be exhausted. Experimental stress levels are transferred into general stress levels of the SAM using the stress-related mortality as a common link. These general stress levels of independent stressors are additive, with the sum determining the total stress exerted on a population. With this approach, we provide a tool that quantitatively predicts the highly synergistic direct effects of independent stressor combinations.",

Food, reserve and structure have constant chemical composition. We here discuss all possible topological alternatives to the standard DEB model, and compare them on the basis of seven properties: the ability to capture weak homeostasis and general empirical growth and reproduction patterns. We selected a reserve dynamics such that reserve mobilisation rate is independent of assimilation, somatic maintenance is proportional to the amount of structure, maturity maintenance to the level of maturity, and assimilation to the surface area. The alternatives only differ from the standard DEB model in topology, but we drop the κ-rule and allow κ to vary with the amount of structure. For this purpose we introduce the concept “generalised von Bertalanffy growth rate” and study how it behaves as a function of the ultimate structural length, both intra- and interspecifically. The 21 derived topological alternatives of the standard DEB are classified into five classes of models, depending on the first allocation event for the assimilation flux. The possibilities of the first allocation event for the assimilation flux are: splitting (κ-models), storing (A-models), both maintenance fluxes simultaneously (P-models), somatic maintenance (S-models) or maturity maintenance (J-models). We conclude that the standard DEB model with constant κ is the only one that passes all our tests successfully. Only assimilation (A) models can naturally accommodate embryo development. The κ-models, which after splitting the fraction 1-κ of assimilates is allocated to maturity maintenance and maturity/reproduction while the fraction κ of assimilates is first stored in reserve or allocated to somatic maintenance, pass most tests, but have maturation and reproduction directly from food. So, embryos have to do this differently and reproduction is prohibited during starvation in these models.",

            "abstract": "We propose an extension of a parameter-free loss function for the estimation of Dynamic Energy Budget parameters for a set of related species that is symmetric in the role of data and predictions. The extension allows that particular parameters might vary, but not by much, among species, while the degree of variation is controlled by weight coefficients. We discuss the choice of these coefficients and illustrate the application with an example of two species of catfish, with their mutual hybrids. In our simultaneous parameter estimation for this example, we could reduce the variation in a parameter, here the energy conductance, substantially with a minor effect on the goodness of fit. We selected this parameter among the ones that varied, because its value was poorly determined by the data. We discuss this example in some detail. The software for implementing this augmented loss function has been implemented in the available software DEBtool_M on Github (www.github.com/add-my-pet/DEBtool_ M).",

Methodology: Using “ammunition”, “military”, “environmental”, “health”, “explosive”, “metal”, “TNT”, “RDX”, “pollution”, and “contamination” as search terms, a large database, namely ISI Web of KnowledgeSM and PubMed, was searched for studies on military ammunition and explosive residues from 1989 to 2010. Other sources used to conduct the search included the library of the Toxicology Laboratory of the Center for Workers’ Health and Human Ecology (CESTEH) at the National School of Public Health. Results: In total, 15 different combinations were used with the search words above and 708 papers were found. Among them, 76 papers concerned this review. More than 12 references of interest were discovered in the library of the CESTEH. The results were organized into metals, dinitrotoluene, trinitrotoluene (TNT), and royal demolition explosive (RDX), showing their main uses, occurrence in the environment, the current toxic effects to human and environmental health, and remediation possibilities. Conclusion: Because military activities can cause the acute and chronic exposure of human beings, the public administration must aim politics towards suitable environmental management.",

The key role of toxicokinetics in determining internal concentrations at target sites means that understanding chemical uptake in mixtures is an essential requirement for mechanistic understanding of interactions. In this paper, a combined approach using mixture toxicity testing, toxicokinetic studies and modelling has been used to address the link between joint toxicity and internal concentration. The study is conducted in Lumbricid earthworms with a binary mixture of a metal (nickel) and an organophosphate insecticide (chlorpyrifos) not a priori expected to show interactive toxicity.",

            "abstract": "Fully artificial test media can increase reproducibility and standardization in ecotoxicological assessments, but there is still a lack of convergence among ecotoxicology laboratories in aquatic test media with respect to ionic composition, chelators, and organic supplements. We compared the performance of Daphnia magna in three widely-used reconstituted media. The tested media differed in composition: (a) ADaM, an artificial medium based in a synthetic sea salt, with no a priori known chelating properties; (b) ASTM hard water supplemented with algal extract, a semi-artificial medium with unknown chelating properties; and (c) M7, a complex artificial medium containing EDTA as a chelator. All three media were suitable for rearing D. magna (although performance in M7 was suboptimal) and acute EC50 values for reference substances (3,4-DCA, K2Cr2O7) were similar between media. In acute exposures to Cu and Cd, daphniids were least sensitive when reared in M7, as expected due to metal chelation by EDTA. Daphnia sensitivity to Cd was low in ADaM. Thus, these two media were suboptimal for assessing the toxicity of some metals to D. magna in acute tests. We suggest that both the ionic composition of the medium and the presence of chelators should be taken into account when metal toxicity is concerned. Chronic toxicity profiles for Cu suggested a mild chelating effect of the algal extract in ASTM medium. Still, ASTM hard water persists as one of the most suitable media for acute toxicity assessments of metals and metal-contaminated samples.",

            "abstract": "Hatchling Lumbricus terrestris, Aporrectodea longa, Allolobophora chlorotica and L. rubellus were cultured in 1-l pots at 15°C in darkness. Each species was grown in isolation and also in the presence of selected adult species representing a range of earthworm ecological groupings. The experiments were continued for 24–36 weeks (until animals matured). The effects of adult presence were determined by measuring survival, growth rate, maturation and cocoon production of original hatchlings. In all treatments greater than 90% of animals survived. Both inter- and intra-specific interactions negatively influenced growth, maturation and fecundity of experimental earthworms. The intensity of interactions was directly related to the degree of niche overlap between pairings. Growth of both anecic and endogeic species was significantly (P $<$0.05) reduced by the presence of adult L. rubellus. The behaviour of anecic hatchlings was seen to change from a sub-surface to a deep burrowing mode after 12 weeks (at approx. 1 g). Growth and cocoon production of A. chlorotica was enhanced by the presence of A. longa. Early growth of L. terrestris was significantly (P $<$0.05) greater in the presence of conspecific adults but such an advantage (possibly mediated by midden formation/use) decreased with age. Results indicated that the outcome of all inter-specific interactions could not be pre-determined by simple reference to ecological grouping. Furthermore the stage of individual earthworm development was seen to influence the intensity of inter- and intra-specific interactions. The results may help to inform field-based studies on earthworm interactions.",

            "abstract": "Developments in ecotoxicology and soil restoration have led to an increase in earthworm research over the past 20 years. Rearing of earthworms under laboratory conditions has therefore become desirable, but perceived difficulties have beset this practice. A review of recent research on the development of earthworm culture techniques for temperate, soil dwelling (anecic and endogeic) species is presented. Critical abiotic and biotic factors including soil moisture, organic matter, temperature, pH, earthworm density and species composition are considered, and optimal values provided for four species (Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa, Aporrectodea longa and Lumbricus terrestris). Published figures relating to growth to maturity, cocoon production and cocoon viability, for these frequently studied species are collated and advice offered for culture of other soil dwelling species.",

            "abstract": "Azole fungicides are highly suspected endocrine disruptors (EDs) and are frequently detected in surface water. Among them, there are prochloraz (PCZ), a commonly used molecule for ED studies, and imazalil (IMZ), a highly suspected ED. Little is known about their toxicokinetic (TK) behavior in fish. Hence, research suggested that an improved risk assessment could be achieved by gaining insight into their TK behavior. The aim of this study is to understand and model the TK of both substances in different fish species, irrespective of the scheme of exposure. TK data from the literature were retrieved including different modes of exposure (per os and waterborne). In addition, two experiments on zebrafish exposed to either IMZ or PCZ were performed to address the lack of in vivo TK data. A physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model applied to IMZ and PCZ was developed, capable of modeling different exposure scenarios. The parameters of the PBK model were simultaneously calibrated on datasets reporting internal concentration in several organs in three fish species (original and literature datasets) by Bayesian methods (Monte Carlo Markov Chain). Model predictions were then compared to other experimental data (i.e., excluded from the calibration step) to assess the predictive performance of the model. The results strongly suggest that PCZ and IMZ are actively transported across the gills, resulting in a small fraction being effectively absorbed by the fish. The model’s results also confirm that both molecules are extensively metabolized by the liver into mainly glucuronate conjugates. Overall, the model performances were satisfying, predicting internal concentrations in several key organs. On average, 90% of experimental data were predicted within a two-fold range. The PBK model allows the understanding of IMZ and PCZ kinetics profiles by accurately predicting internal concentrations in three different fish species regardless of the exposure scenario. This enables a proper understanding of the mechanism of action of EDs at the molecular initiating event (MIE) by predicting bioaccumulation in target organs, thus linking this MIE to a possible adverse outcome.",

            "abstract": "Twenty commonly used pharmaceuticals including eight chiral drugs were investigated in Dongting Lake, China. The contamination level was relatively low on a global scale. Twelve pharmaceuticals were identified. The most abundant compound was caffeine followed by diclofenac, DEET, mefenamic acid, fluoxetine, ibuprofen and carbamazepine with mean concentrations from 2.0 to 80.8 ng L−1. Concentrations between East and West Dongting Lake showed spatial difference, with the West Dongting Lake less polluted. The relatively high ratio of caffeine versus carbamazepine (over 50) may indicate there was possible direct discharge of domestic wastewater into the lake. This is the first study presenting a survey allowing for comprehensive analysis of multiclass achiral and chiral pharmaceuticals including beta-blockers, antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs in freshwater lake. The enantiomeric compositions presented racemic to weakly enantioselective, with the highest enantiomeric fraction (EF) of 0.63 for fluoxetine. Meanwhile, venlafaxine was identified and evaluated the environment risk in surface water in China for the first time. The results of risk assessment suggested that fluoxetine, venlafaxine and diclofenac acid might pose a significant risk to aquatic organisms in Dongting Lake. The resulting data will be useful to enrich the research of emerging pollutants in freshwater lake and stereochemistry for environment investigations.",

            "abstract": "Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of “significance” should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many nonfamiliar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their “behavior” in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.",

            "abstract": "Ultramafic soils are characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals of natural origin—such as chromium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel—as well as a shortage of primary nutrients. This can result in extremely disadvantageous living conditions for all soil-dwelling organisms. Responses to these conditions were addressed by studying growth, cocoon production, and fecundity of earthworms as endpoints of sublethal effects and how this influences the reproductive system and, consequently, population development. Mature specimens of two ecophysiologically different species of earthworms, Eisenia fetida (Savigny) and Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny), were exposed for 56 days to an uncontaminated soil and ultramafic soils collected from six ultramafic sites in the Barberton greenstone belt. In all ultramafic soil samples, the specimens of both species grew slower than those in the control soil. In A. caliginosa, an autotomization of the tail section was observed at higher concentrations of heavy metals. At high levels of heavy metals such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and cobalt, a significantly lower cocoon production was recorded for E. fetida, and at medium levels, a time delay in cocoon production was found. A. caliginosa showed an increase in production at medium levels and a decrease at high levels of heavy metals. In both species, no correlation between growth and cocoon viability was found, indicating different target levels for toxicants present in ultramafic soils. To determine effects of these soils on population dynamics, hatching success may be a more useful endpoint of reproduction.",

            "abstract": "Neonicotinoids are the most widely used class of insecticides in the world, but they have raised numerous concerns regarding their effects on biodiversity. Thus, the objective of this work was to do a critical review of the contamination of the environment (soil, water, air, biota) by neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam) and of their impacts on terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity. Neonicotinoids are very frequently detected in soils and in freshwater, and they are also found in the air. They have only been recently monitored in coastal and marine environments, but some studies already reported the presence of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam in transitional or semi-enclosed ecosystems (lagoons, bays, and estuaries). The contamination of the environment leads to the exposure and to the contamination of non-target organisms and to negative effects on biodiversity. Direct impacts of neonicotinoids are mainly reported on terrestrial invertebrates (e.g., pollinators, natural enemies, earthworms) and vertebrates (e.g., birds) and on aquatic invertebrates (e.g., arthropods). Impacts on aquatic vertebrate populations and communities, as well as on microorganisms, are less documented. In addition to their toxicity to directly exposed organisms, neonicotinoid induce indirect effects via trophic cascades as demonstrated in several species (terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates). However, more data are needed to reach firmer conclusions and to get a clearer picture of such indirect effects. Finally, we identified specific knowledge gaps that need to be filled to better understand the effects of neonicotinoids on terrestrial, freshwater, and marine organisms, as well as on ecosystem services associated with these biotas.",

            "abstract": "The collection of chemical structure information and associated experimental data for quantitative structure–activity/ property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) modeling is facilitated by an increasing number of public databases containing large amounts of useful data. However, the performance of QSAR models highly depends on the quality of the data and modeling methodology used. This study aims to develop robust QSAR/QSPR models for chemical properties of environmental interest that can be used for regulatory purposes. This study primarily uses data from the publicly available PHYSPROP database consisting of a set of 13 common physicochemical and environmental fate properties. These datasets have undergone extensive curation using an automated workflow to select only high-quality data, and the chemical structures were standardized prior to calculation of the molecular descriptors. The modeling procedure was developed based on the five Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) principles for QSAR models. A weighted k-nearest neighbor approach was adopted using a minimum number of required descriptors calculated using PaDEL, an open-source software. The genetic algorithms selected only the most pertinent and mechanistically interpretable descriptors (2–15, with an average of 11 descriptors). The sizes of the modeled datasets varied from 150 chemicals for biodegradability half-life to 14,050 chemicals for logP, with an average of 3222 chemicals across all endpoints. The optimal models were built on randomly selected training sets (75%) and validated using fivefold cross-validation (CV) and test sets (25%). The CV ­Q2 of the models varied from 0.72 to 0.95, with an average of 0.86 and an ­R2 test value from 0.71 to 0.96, with an average of 0.82. Modeling and performance details are described in QSAR model reporting format and were validated by the European Commission’s Joint Research Center to be OECD compliant. All models are freely available as an open-source, command-line application called OPEn structure–activity/property Relationship App (OPERA). OPERA models were applied to more than 750,000 chemicals to produce freely available predicted data on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s CompTox Chemistry Dashboard.",

            "abstract": "\"Dans l’Union européenne (UE) la source principale de médicaments humains dans l’environnement est l’excrétion des patients. Ces médicaments n’ont pas été conçus en considération de leur devenir postutilisation et les stations de traitement des eaux usées (STEU) urbaines n’ont pas été conçues pour les éliminer. Face à cette situation a été développée une démarche en trois étapes. La première phase a consisté à identifier les acteurs du cycle de vie des médicaments et analyser les réglementations françaises et européennes applicables. La deuxième phase a permis de comparer les modes de gestion de cette pollution en Allemagne, Suède et Suisse pour identifier les solutions mises en place et les incitations qui ont conduit ces États à agir. La dernière phase consistera à regrouper les précédents résultats pour identifier les mesures coercitives et/ou incitatives transposables en France, voire à l’UE pour déployer ces solutions. Les deux premières phases ont permis de mettre en évidence les limites et évolutions des réglementations européennes et françaises en matière de rejet des médicaments humains dans l’eau. Il en ressort que la France n’a pas de cadre réglementaire approprié pour gérer cette pollution, et semble fortement attachée aux actions de réduction à la source. Une intervention sur l’ensemble du cycle de vie des médicaments serait pourtant nécessaire. Des actions de réduction à la source ne sont pas efficaces à court terme et les actions correctives sont coûteuses et insuffisantes seules. Les réglementations et politiques publiques doivent être décloisonnées pour aller vers des mesures transversales mettant tous les acteurs à contribution. Les évolutions européennes récentes (nationales et supranationales) laissent présager la demande de traitements avancés dans les STEU et un cadre plus contraignant pour le retour au sol des boues, mais se pose la question du financement.\"",

            "abstract": "Summary 1. Interest in measuring individual variation in reaction norms using mixed‐effects and, more specifically, random regression models have grown apace in the last few years within evolution and ecology. However, these are data hungry methods, and little effort to date has been put into understanding how much and what kind of data we need to collect in order to apply these models usefully and reliably. 2. We conducted simulations to address three central questions. First, what is the best sampling strategy to collect sufficient data to test for individual variation using random regression models? Second, on occasions when precision is difficult to assess, can we be confident that a failure to detect significant variance in plasticity using random regression represents a biological reality rather than a lack of statistical power? Finally, does the common practice of censoring individuals with one or few repeated measures improve or reduce power to estimate individual variation in random regressions? 3. We have also developed a series of easy‐to‐use functions in the “pamm” statistical package for R, which is freely available, that will allow researchers to conduct similar power analyses tailored more specifically to their own data. 4. Our results reveal potentially useful rules of thumb: large data sets ( N $\\quad>\\quad$200) are needed to evaluate the variance of individual‐specific slopes; a number of individuals/number of observations per individual ratio of approximately 0·5 consistently yielded the highest power to detect random effects; individuals with one or few observations should not generally be censored as this reduces power to detect variance in plasticity. 5. We discuss the wider implications of these simulations and remaining challenges and suggest a new way to standardize results that would better facilitate the comparison of findings across empirical studies.",

            "abstract": "Psychoactive pollutants, such as antidepressants, are increasingly detected in the environment. Mounting evidence suggests that such pollutants can disrupt the behaviour of non-target species. Despite this, few studies have considered how the response of exposed organisms might be mediated by social context. To redress this, we investigated the impacts of two environmentally realistic concentrations of a pervasive antidepressant pollutant, fluoxetine, on foraging behaviour in fish ( Gambusia holbrooki ), tested individually or in a group. Fluoxetine did not alter behaviour of solitary fish. However, in a group setting, fluoxetine exposure disrupted the frequency of aggressive interactions and food consumption, with observed effects being contingent on both the mean weight of group members and the level of within-group variation in weight. Our results suggest that behavioural tests in social isolation may not accurately predict the environmental risk of chemical pollutants for group-living species and highlight the potential for social context to mediate the effects of psychoactive pollutants in exposed wildlife.",

            "abstract": "The occasionally observed differential chemical sensitivity in embryonic life stages of fish is still poorly understood and could represent an important issue for understanding the time course of toxicity and the toxic modes of action of chemicals. In this study we analyzed the toxicity of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor azinphos-methyl (APM) in different life-stages of zebrafish embryos. To this end, the LC50 of three 48 h-exposure windows were determined (12 ␮M for 0–48, no mortality observed for 24–72 and 72–120 hpf up to a concentration of 79 ␮M). We hypothesized that the differential sensitivity of the stage-specific embryos may be related to differences in uptake of the compound and/or internal concentrations. Therefore, internal concentrations were determined using HPLC. Similar levels and time courses of internal concentrations for all three exposure windows were observed. Bioconcentration amounted to a factor of about 30. Short-term exposure windows for a concentration 4-fold above the calculated LC50 (47 ␮M) identified the period of 0–4 hpf as the most sensitive time window for APM toxicity. Our results indicate that the differential sensitivity of APM in the embryos is not related to differences in internal concentrations but related to a stage specific mechanisms of toxicity.",

            "abstract": "Dispersal capacity is a life-history trait that may have profound consequences for earthworm populations: it influences population dynamics, species persistence and distribution and community structure. It also determines the level of gene flow between populations and affects processes such as local adaptation, speciation and the evolution of life-history traits. It may play a great role in soil functioning by determining the spatial distribution of ecosystem engineers such as earthworms. Dispersal is an evolutionary outcome of the behaviour in response to the ecological constraints of the species. Hence different dispersal behaviour is expected from the different ecological types of earthworms. Nevertheless the dispersal behaviour of earthworms has been little documented.",

There is growing evidence that mechanistic models of earthworm population dynamics are promising tools to tackle this issue. However, this approach requires a fair amount of data because it explicitly integrates the three fundamental biological processes: growth, reproduction and mortality. Hitherto, the lack of comprehensive databases on life history parameters related to these three processes hampered the widespread development of mechanistic earthworm population dynamics models. As a consequence, predicting earthworm abundance in a variety of conditions across species is still difficult.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms play a key role in soil and ecosystem functioning. Predicting their abundance and spatial distribution is required to understand their ecological role. There is growing evidence that mechanistic models of earthworm population dynamics are promising tools to tackle this issue. However, this approach requires a fair amount of data because it explicitly integrates the three fundamental biological processes: growth, reproduction and mortality. Hitherto, the lack of comprehensive databases on life history parameters related to these three processes hampered the widespread development of mechanistic earthworm population dynamics models. As a consequence, predicting earthworm abundance in a variety of conditions across species is still difficult.",

DEB models were successfully used to assess the influence of stress, including toxic substances, and changes in pH and temperature, on different organisms. In this study, the Standard DEB model was used to evaluate the toxicity of copper and cadmium ions and their binary mixtures on Daphnia magna. Both metal ions have a significant in­ fluence on daphnia growth and reproduction. Different physiological modes of action (pMoA) were applied to primary DEB model parameters. Model predictions for chosen modes of interaction of mixture components were evaluated. The goodness of model fit and the model prediction was assessed to indicate the most likely pMoA and interaction mode. Copper and cadmium influence more than one DEB model primary parameter. Different pMoAs can result in similar model fits, and therefore it is difficult to identify pMoA only by evaluation of the goodness of fit of the model to the growth and reproduction data. Some critical discussion and ideas for model development are therefore provided.",

This is partly because such compounds tend to volatilize from aqueous solution and partly because of sorption to the algal biomass as well as to the test container. A simple filled closed bottle test with low algal densities and bicarbonate enrichment is described here as an approach to minimize the loss of test material from solution. The algal medium was enriched with 300 mg NaHCO3/L, the pH was adjusted to 7.0 by addition of HCl, and the resulting dissolved CO2 concentration supported maximum algal growth rates without pH drift for algal densities up to 4 mg dry weight/L. Two-day toxicity tests with kerosene were performed with this new test design and compared with an open bottle test and with a closed bottle test with headspace. Exposure concentrations of the volatile fraction of kerosene decreased by 99% in the open test, by 77% in the closed flask test with headspace, and by 16% in the filled closed bottle test. Algal growth inhibition was observed at much lower additions of kerosene in the new test design because of the improved maintenance of a constant exposure.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms are important and useful soil organisms, but in agricultural soils, they are potentially exposed to a wide variety of pesticides. Insecticides represent the highest threat to earthworms and many are neurotoxic. There is a need for a reliable, relevant, simple biomarker to assess the sub-lethal effects of neurotoxic insecticides on earthworms under laboratory or field conditions. The Aporrectodea caliginosa earthworms were exposed to 0 (control), 0.5×, 1× (normal field application rate), and 5× concentrations of a carbamate (Pirimor®) and an organophosphate (Lorsban®) insecticides. The nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of the medial giant fibers of A. caliginosa earthworm was recorded on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 to quantify sub-lethal neurotoxic effects. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity of A. caliginosa homogenates was measured at the conclusion of the experiment. Pirimor® but not Lorsban® induced a significant decrease in NCV on days 3, 4, and 7 at 1× and 5× doses. A significant dose-dependent decrease was observed on AChE activity to Pirimor® at the doses used but not Lorsban®. A clear relationship is observed between AChE activity and NCV in the case of Pirimor®. This study showed that NCV is a sensitive biomarker that correlates well with classical biomarker measurements such as AChE enzyme activity. This technique could be used to study the impact of insecticides on earthworms and also their recovery.",

            "abstract": "As a contribution to the 2015 Global Soil Security Conference, we estimated the value of ecosystem service contributions by soil. The general purpose of this estimate was to give soil a value with respect to natural capital, to compare that value to other values recognised in the global economy and to start a conversation among soil scientists and economist about the value of soil. In particular, we want to incite a conversation about the value of soil beyond that discussed using commodity prices. The simple estimate of the value ecosystem services from soil is approximately 11.4 trillion USD, which compares to the 2015 gross domestic product of the USA at 15 trillion USD. The original source used for this estimate has been updated. In general the updated values of global ecosystem service are now at 2.7 times the original, which likely increases our estimate by a similar multiplier. The concept of estimating a value for global ecosystem services is criticised by many economists. However, understanding the change in the value of soil for ecosystems services provision because of changes in soil management and use gives a valuation that is critical for policy decisions regarding soil security.",

            "abstract": "Abstract On microevolutionary timescales, adaptive evolution depends upon both natural selection and the underlying genetic architecture of traits under selection, which may constrain evolutionary outcomes. Whether such genetic constraints shape phenotypic diversity over macroevolutionary timescales is more controversial, however. One key prediction is that genetic constraints should bias the early stages of species divergence along “genetic lines of least resistance” defined by the genetic (co)variance matrix, G. This bias is expected to erode over time as species means and G matrices diverge, allowing phenotypes to evolve away from the major axis of variation. We tested for evidence of this signal in West Indian Anolis lizards, an iconic example of adaptive radiation. We found that the major axis of morphological evolution was well aligned with a major axis of genetic variance shared by all species despite separation times of 20–40 million years, suggesting that divergence occurred along a conserved genetic line of least resistance. Further, this signal persisted even as G itself evolved, apparently because the largest evolutionary changes in G were themselves aligned with the line of genetic least resistance. Our results demonstrate that the signature of genetic constraint may persist over much longer timescales than previously appreciated, even in the presence of evolving genetic architecture. This pattern may have arisen either because pervasive constraints have biased the course of adaptive evolution or because the G matrix itself has been shaped by selection to conform to the adaptive landscape.",

            "abstract": "Two popular approaches for modeling social evolution, evolutionary game theory and quantitative genetics, ask complementary questions but are rarely integrated. Game theory focuses on evolutionary outcomes, with models solving for evolutionarily stable equilibria, whereas quantitative genetics provides insight into evolutionary processes, with models predicting short-term responses to selection. Here we draw parallels between evolutionary game theory and interacting phenotypes theory, which is a quantitative genetic framework for understanding social evolution. First, we show how any evolutionary game may be translated into two quantitative genetic selection gradients, nonsocial and social selection, which may be used to predict evolutionary change from a single round of the game. We show that synergistic fitness effects may alter predicted selection gradients, causing changes in magnitude and sign as the population mean evolves. Second, we show how evolutionary games involving plastic behavioral responses to partners can be modeled using indirect genetic effects, which describe how trait expression changes in response to genes in the social environment. We demonstrate that repeated social interactions in models of reciprocity generate indirect effects and conversely, that estimates of parameters from indirect genetic effect models may be used to predict the evolution of reciprocity. We argue that a pluralistic view incorporating both theoretical approaches will benefit empiricists and theorists studying social evolution. We advocate the measurement of social selection and indirect genetic effects in natural populations to test the predictions from game theory and, in turn, the use of game theory models to aid in the interpretation of quantitative genetic estimates.",

            "abstract": "Individual variation in sub-lethal sensitivity to the organophosphate pesticide trichlorfon was investigated in Nile tilapia, using critical swimming speed (Ucrit) as an indicator. Tilapia exposed for 96 h to 500 μg l−1 trichlorfon at 26 °C (Tcfn group, n = 27) showed a significant decline in mean Ucrit, compared to their own control (pre-exposure) performance in clean water (−14.5 ± 2.3%, mean ± SEM), but also compared to a Sham group (n = 10) maintained for 96 h in clean water. Individuals varied in their relative sensitivity to the pesticide, with the decline in Ucrit after exposure varying from 1 to 41%. The Ucrit of the Tcfn group did not recover completely after 96 h in clean water, remaining 9.4 ± 3.2% below their own control performance. The decline in performance was associated with a significant increase in net cost of aerobic swimming, of +28.4 ± 6.5% at a sustained speed of 2 bodylengths s−1, which translated into a significant decline in swimming efficiency (Eswim) of −17.6 ± 4.0% at that speed. Within the Tcfn group, individual Eswim was a strong positive determinant of individual Ucrit across all trials, and a strong negative determinant of individual% decline in Ucrit after pesticide exposure (P $<$ 0.001, linear mixed effect models). Trichlorfon had no effects on standard metabolic rate or active metabolic rate (AMR) but, nonetheless, individual Ucrit in all trials, and% decline in Ucrit after exposure, were strongly associated with individual AMR (positively and negatively, respectively, P $<$ 0.001). Individual Ucrit under control conditions was also a strong positive determinant of Ucrit after trichlorfon exposure (P $<$ 0.001), but not of the% decline in Ucrit performance. In conclusion, the OP pesticide impaired Ucrit performance by reducing Eswim but individual tilapia varied widely in their relative sensitivity. Intrinsic individual physiology determined effects of the pesticide on performance and, in particular, good swimmers remained better swimmers after exposure.",

In relation to this, we present four testable hypotheses considering that micro-evolution due to pollution acts upon the variability of functional response traits of the exposed populations and generates changes on their functional effect traits, therefore, modifying the way species exploit their ecological niches and participate in the overall ecosystem functioning.",

            "abstract": "Although a plethora of models exist to describe the characteristics and risk assessment of chemical mixtures in ecotoxicology, there is no specific procedure to decide on the mixing ratios (i.e. proportions of the individual chemical substances that form the mixture) at any desired level of concentration in an ecotoxicological mixture experiment. In this study, an attempt was made to develop a procedure for determining the mixing ratios in ecotoxicological experiments. In brief, from a single salt exposure test, the relative toxic fractions, which represent the toxic effect exerted by the individual salts, are determined. Thereafter, the proportions of each individual salt at any level of concentration in the mixture are estimated by multiplying the desired concentration with the relative toxic fraction of that particular salt. The procedure was applied to ecotoxicological experiments involving four binary salt mixtures (MgCl2 + MgSO4, NaCl + Na2SO4, MgCl2 + Na2SO4 and NaCl + MgSO4) and Caridina nilotica, an indigenous South African freshwater shrimp. It is hoped that the application of this developed procedure will ensure administering the correct proportions of individual chemical substances in chemical mixtures in order to obtain the desired levels of concentration in aquatic ecotoxicological mixture experiments.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have recorded phenotypic changes in natural populations and attributed them to climate change. However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing – and exclusion – of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known – and not known – about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed – and these must employ better inferential methods –before general conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we hope that the present paper and special issue provide inspiration for future research and guidelines on best practices for its execution.",

            "abstract": "The comparative analysis of fecundity and fertility was studied experimentally for the amphimictic Aporrectodea caliginosa diploid earthworms and the close parthenogenetic A. trapezoides triploid earthworms during two seasons. The individual fecundity of cocoons at is significantly higher in the parthenogenetic species than in amphimictic one. Fertility is in contrast lower in the parthenogenetic species, which results in leveled parameters of the reproductive potential. A generalization and analysis of the available data on the comparative fecundity of representatives of different animal groups shows that the automatic increase in fecundity in same-sex organisms due to the exclusion of males cannot be considered a universal rule providing biological progress and the ecological advantage of parthenogenetic organisms. This explanation is not suitable for hermaphroditic organisms. In addition, in some cases, parthenogenetic reproduction is accompanied by reduced fertility and even reduced fecundity.",

            "abstract": "The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis posits that suites of traits are correlated along a slow-fast continuum owing to life history trade-offs. Despite widespread adoption, environmental conditions driving the emergence of POLS remain unclear. A recently proposed conceptual framework of POLS suggests that a slow-fast continuum should align to fluctuations in density-dependent selection. We tested three key predictions made by this framework with an eco-evolutionary agent-based population model. Selection acted on responsiveness (behavioral trait) to interpatch resource differences and the reproductive investment threshold (life history trait). Across environments with density fluctuations of different magnitudes, we observed the emergence of a common axis of trait covariation between and within populations (i.e., the evolution of a POLS). Slowtype (fast-type) populations with high (low) responsiveness and low (high) reproductive investment threshold were selected at high (low) population densities and less (more) intense and frequent density fluctuations. In support of the predictions, fast-type populations contained a higher degree of variation in traits and were associated with higher intrinsic reproductive rate (r0) and higher sensitivity to intraspecific competition (g), pointing to a universal trade-off. While our findings support that POLS aligns with density-dependent selection, we discuss possible mechanisms that may lead to alternative evolutionary pathways.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic organisms are exposed to mixtures of chemicals that may interact. Mixtures of atrazine (ATR) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) may elicit synergic effects on the permanent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in certain aquatic organisms, causing severe damage. Mechanistic mathematical models of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics (TD) may be used to better characterize and understand the interactions of these two chemicals. In this study, a previously published generic physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model for fish was adapted to ATR and CPF. A sub-model of the kinetics of one of the main metabolites of CPF, chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPF-oxon), was included, as well as a TD model. Inhibition of two esterases, AChE and carboxylesterase, by ATR, CPF and CPF-oxon, was modeled using TD modeling of quantities of total and inactive esterases. Specific attention was given to the parameterization and calibration of the model to accurately predict the concentration and effects observed in the fish using Bayesian inference and published data from fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). A PBTK-TD for mixtures was used to predict dose-response relationships for comparison with available adult fish data. Synergistic effects of a joint exposure to ATR and CPF could not be demonstrated in adult fish.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies into community level dynamics are revealing processes and patterns that underpin the biodiversity and complexity of natural ecosystems. Theoretical food webs have suggested that speciesrich and highly complex communities are inherently unstable, but incorporating certain characteristics of empirical communities, such as allometric body size scaling and non-random interaction distributions, have been shown to enhance stability and facilitate species coexistence. Incorporating individual level traits and variability into food web theory is seen as a future pathway for this research and our growing knowledge of individual behaviours, in the form of temperament (or personality) traits, can inform the direction of this research. Temperament traits are consistent differences in behaviour between individuals, which are repeatable across time and/or across ecological contexts, such as aggressive or boldness behaviours that commonly differ between individuals of the same species. These traits, under the framework of behavioural reaction norms, show both individual consistency as well as contextual and phenotypic plasticity. This is likely to contribute significantly to the effects of individual trait variability and adaptive trophic behaviour on the structure and dynamics of food webs, which are apparently stabilizing. Exploring the role of temperament in the context of community ecology is a unique opportunity for cross-pollination between ecological fields, and can provide new insights into community stability and biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "Thermal time and hydrotime models have been developed to predict the development of various organisms with life traits regulated by temperature and humidity. They consider development rate to increase linearly with temperature or water availability above a base temperature or water potential. The objective of this work was to integrate concepts from thermal time and hydrotime models to describe the combined effects of temperature and water potential on development and growth of temperate earthworms. The model was calibrated with experimental data from the scientific literature. When water potential conditions were favourable for earthworms, the thermal time model suggested a linear increase in cocoon development and growth with increasing temperature between the base temperature (Tb) and the optimal temperature (To) followed by a linear decline in these parameters between To and the ceiling temperature (Tc). The model predicted Tb values of 4.3 C and 2.5 C, To values of 21.2 C and 17.6 C, and Tc values of 38.1 C and 25.8 C for cocoon development and growth, respectively. Development and growth rates were maximal at optimal temperatures To of 21.2 and 17.6 C, respectively. Cocoon development rate and growth rate increased linearly between Tb and To. Above To, development and growth rates decreased linearly until Tc, at which both rates are null. For anecic species, Tc was found to be 38.1 and 25.8 C for cocoon development and growth, respectively. At constant temperature, cocoon development and growth decreased linearly with water potential, as described by the hydrotime model. Base water potential (the water potential at which life history parameter values are zero) was found to be close to very wet conditions for growth (À23 and À10 kPa for juveniles and adults, respectively) and cocoon production (À32 kPa). The integrated model incorporated the effect of water potential into the thermal time model. Water potential modified the three cardinal temperatures (Tb, To and Tc) for growth and the growth rate at To, but not the slopes of the relationships between growth rate and temperature. Thus, increasing water potential reduced the temperature range at which earthworm growth was possible and the maximum growth at the optimal temperature. No data was available to validate this model for cocoon development.",

            "abstract": "Significance There is currently great concern about the ability of organisms to adapt to warmer environments. During heat waves, upper thermal tolerance is often critical for survival, but it is largely unknown how rapidly tolerance can evolve, especially in vertebrates. We artificially selected on upper thermal tolerance in a tropical fish to see whether and how quickly thermal tolerance evolves, and how warm acclimation prior to a thermal challenge alters this evolutionary process. Upper thermal tolerance evolved but at a slow rate toward higher temperature. Furthermore, acclimation capacity decreased in the lines selected for higher thermal tolerance. These results suggest that tropical fishes will struggle to adapt in pace with the current climate warming. , Climate change is increasing global temperatures and intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme heat waves. How organisms will cope with these changes depends on their inherent thermal tolerance, acclimation capacity, and ability for evolutionary adaptation. Yet, the potential for adaptation of upper thermal tolerance in vertebrates is largely unknown. We artificially selected offspring from wild-caught zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) to increase (Up-selected) or decrease (Down-selected) upper thermal tolerance over six generations. Selection to increase upper thermal tolerance was also performed on warm-acclimated fish to test whether plasticity in the form of inducible warm tolerance also evolved. Upper thermal tolerance responded to selection in the predicted directions. However, compared to the control lines, the response was stronger in the Down-selected than in the Up-selected lines in which evolution toward higher upper thermal tolerance was slow (0.04 ± 0.008 °C per generation). Furthermore, the scope for plasticity resulting from warm acclimation decreased in the Up-selected lines. These results suggest the existence of a hard limit in upper thermal tolerance. Considering the rate at which global temperatures are increasing, the observed rates of adaptation and the possible hard limit in upper thermal tolerance suggest a low potential for evolutionary rescue in tropical fish living at the edge of their thermal limits.",

In ecology and evolution, meta‐analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen’s / Hedges’ d or the response ratio. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic ln CVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta‐analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two‐group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta‐analytic data sets that compare two‐group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta‐analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.",

            "abstract": "The taxonomy of earthworms has been riddled by instability, lack of systematically useful characters, and lax diagnoses of some genera. This has led to the use of some genera such as Allolobophora Eisen, 1874 as taxonomic wastebaskets, blurring their evolution and biogeographical history. The implementation of molecular techniques has revolutionized the systematics of the genus; however, some of its species have not been previously included in molecular phylogenetic analyses. Thus, the molecular markers COI, 16S, ND1, 12S, and 28S were sequenced for six endemic species including several taxa of Allolobophora and Aporrectodea Örely, 1885 (another related catch-all genus). Phylogenetic relationships determined by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses support the status of two of the six taxa examined (Allolobophora burgondiae Bouché, 1972 and Aporrectodea icterica Savigny, 1826) as part of Allolobophora sensu stricto and a presumed synonymy between Allolobophora and Heraclescolex Qiu and Bouché, 1998. Branch lengths and average pairwise genetic distances support the transfer of Allolobophora satchelli Bouché, 1972 to the genus Panoniona Mršić and Šapkarev, 1988 and the emergence of two new genera, Heraultia gen. nov. and Vosgesia gen. nov., endemic to France, hosting Allolobophora tiginosa Bouché, 1972 and Allolobophora zicsii Bouché, 1972, respectively. The aforementioned changes of status and the diagnosis for Heraultia and Vosgesia are presented. These results provided more evolutionarily and biogeographically coherent earthworm groups and highlighted that the Maghreb and the area around the Alps are potential key locations for the diversification of Allolobophora and several lineages of Lumbricidae.",

This study aimed at comparing the dissipation and bioavailability to earthworms of two fungicides, dimoxystrobin (DMX) and epoxiconazole (EPX), over 12 months under laboratory and field conditions. In both approaches, the fungicides were applied to the same loamy soil as a formulated mixture at several concentrations. We determined total DMX and EPX concentrations in the soil using exhaustive extraction, their environmental availability using mild extraction, and their bioavailability through internal concentrations in exposed earthworms. The initial fungicide application appeared as much better controlled in terms of dose and homogeneity in the laboratory than in the field. One year after application, a similar dissipation rate was observed between the laboratory and field experiments (ca 80% and 60% for DMX and EPX, respectively). Similarly, the ratio of available/total concentrations in soil displayed the same trend whatever the duration and the conditions (field or lab), EPX being more available than DMX. Finally, the environmental bioavailability of the two fungicides to earthworms was heterogeneous in the field, but, in the laboratory, the bioaccumulation was evidenced to be dose-dependent only for DMX. Our findings suggest that the actual fate of the two considered fungicides in the environment is consistent with the one determined in the laboratory, although the conditions differed (e.g., presence of vegetation, endogeic earthworm species). This study allowed better understanding of the fate of the two considered active substances in the soil and underlined the need for more research dedicated to the link between environmental and toxicological bioavailability.",

            "abstract": "The mean value of any parameter and its changes are usually discussed, when ecotoxicological studies are carried out. However, also the variation of any parameter and its changes can be important components of the responses to environmental contamination. Although the homogeneity of variances is commonly tested, testing is done for the use of correct statistical methods, not because of exploring the possibility that variability and its changes could be important components of environmental responses. We evaluated recent aquatic toxicological literature and found that in the majority of articles indicating that homogeneity of variances was tested and giving the result of testing, the assumption of homogeneity was not fulfilled. Further, it was observed that in some studies experimental treatment clearly affected the variability. In this commentary we discuss the reasons for variability: measurement errors, experimental design, genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity, and conclude that even after accounting for experimental design and genetic makeup significant variability remains. This plasticity may change in environmental responses as suggested by a hypothetical example, and as confirmed by experimental data. As a consequence, the changes of variability can be significant, even when the means do not differ. Because of this, variability and its changes should always be analysed and reported. This will be easy, since the datasets are exactly the same for comparing the variances and means, and as normally variances are tested for homogeneity. It is likely that much new information about the responses of organisms to environmental contamination will be obtained. However, the present journal practises tend to discourage one from concentrating on anything but the mean. In contrast, we think it is imperative that variability is always included as an endpoint in data analysis in the future.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic energy budget models relate phenomena at many levels of ecological organization and can provide quantitative links from individual physiology to population, community, and ecosystem dynamics. A prerequisite for making these links is an empirically tested model of growth and reproduction for individual organisms in a temporally variable environment. We construct a model that is applicable to organisms with indeterminate growth. By applying a recent statistical approach attributable to S. N. Wood, we use the model to infer the size dependence of feeding rates and of energy allocation to growth vs. reproduction for Daphnia from new laboratory data on growth and egg production. The implied feeding rates are consistent with independent measurements. With one additional assumption, respiration rates can be predicted; they scale with size in a manner consistent with previous measurements of respiration allometry. These findings support the use of inverse methods to determine physiologically based functions and parameters for subsequent use in population and ecosystem models.",

            "abstract": "The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac is one of the most frequently studied as well as controversially discussed pharmaceutically active drug on the subject of its relevance to the environment. This study was conducted to assess the bioconcentration potential of diclofenac and its behavioral and biochemical effects in Daphnia magna. The bioconcentration factors of diclofenac determined after 48 h of aqueous exposure in Daphnia magna were 70.94 and 8.02 for the nominal exposure concentrations of 5 and 100 μg/L, respectively. Diclofenac exposure obviously decreased the filtration and ingestion rates of the daphnids. A significant increase of the acetylcholinesterase activity that was observed in this study indicates that diclofenac might not have neurobehavioral toxicity in Daphnia magna. Significant induction of malondialdehyde content is an indication of overproduction of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative damage in daphnids after diclofenac exposure. Moreover, significant inhibition of the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase activities implies that the antioxidant defense system of Daphnia magna was overwhelmed. Also, significant inhibition of glutathione s-transferase activity might point to the fact that the enzyme was not capable to detoxify diclofenac in Daphnia magna. These findings indicate that diclofenac can accumulate and consequently stimulate behavioral and biochemical disturbances in Daphnia magna.",

            "abstract": "Environmentally induced phenotypes have been proposed to initiate and bias adaptive evolutionary change toward particular directions. The potential for this to happen depends in part on how well plastic responses are aligned with the additive genetic variance and covariance in traits. Using meta-analysis, we demonstrate that plastic responses to novel environments tend to occur along phenotype dimensions that harbor substantial amounts of additive genetic variation. This suggests that selection for or against environmentally induced phenotypes typically will be effective. One interpretation of the alignment between the direction of plasticity and the main axis of additive genetic variation is that developmental systems tend to respond to environmental novelty as they do to genetic mutation. This makes it challenging to distinguish if the direction of evolution is biased by plasticity or genetic “constraint.” Our results therefore highlight a need for new theoretical and empirical approaches to address the role of plasticity in evolution.",

            "abstract": "Background, aim and scope The ergosterol biosynthesisinhibiting (EBI) fungicide prochloraz can enhance the effect of other pesticides in a range of animal species. Approximately 50% of the fungicides used in Denmark are EBI fungicides. Hence, if they all have synergising potential, a risk assessment of pesticide mixtures based on additivity might not suffice. This study investigates the synergising potential of six different EBI fungicides representing the imidazoles (prochloraz), the triazoles (epoxiconazole, propiconazole and tebuconazole), the piperidines (fenpropidin) and the morpholines (fenpropimorph) together with the pyrethroid insecticide alpha-cypermethrin.",

            "abstract": "Pesticides are often toxic to nontarget organisms, especially to those living in rivers that drain agricultural land. The brown trout (Salmo trutta) is a keystone species in many such rivers, and natural populations have hence been chronically exposed to pesticides over multiple generations. The introduction of pesticides decades ago could have induced evolutionary responses within these populations. Such a response would be predicted to reduce the toxicity over time but also deplete any additive genetic variance for the tolerance to the pesticides. If so, populations are now expected to differ in their susceptibility and in the variance for the tolerance depending on the pesticides they have been exposed to. We sampled breeders from seven natural populations that differ in their habitats and that show significant genetic differentiation. We stripped them for their gametes and produced 118 families by in vitro fertilization. We then raised 20 embryos per family singly in experimentally controlled conditions and exposed them to one of two ecologically relevant concentrations of either the herbicide S-metolachlor or the insecticide diazinon. Both pesticides affected embryo and larval development at all concentrations. We found no statistically significant additive genetic variance for tolerance to these stressors within or between populations. Tolerance to the pesticides could also not be linked to variation in carotenoid content of the eggs. However, pesticide tolerance was linked to egg size, with smaller eggs being more tolerant to the pesticides than larger eggs. We conclude that an evolutionary response to these pesticides is currently unlikely and that (a) continuous selection in the past has either depleted genetic variance in all the populations we studied or (b) that exposure to the pesticides never induced an evolutionary response. The observed toxicity selects against large eggs that are typically spawned by larger and older females.",

            "abstract": "Tests with zebrafish embryos have gained wide acceptance as an alternative test model for drug development and toxicity testing. In particular, the behavioral response of the zebrafish embryo is currently seen as a useful endpoint to diagnose neuroactive substances. Consequently, several behavioral test methods have been developed addressing various behavioral endpoints such as spontaneous tail coiling (STC), photomotor response (PMR), locomotor response (LMR) and alternating light/dark-induced locomotor response (LMR-L/D). Although these methods are distinct in their application, most of their protocols differ quite strongly in the use of experimental parameters and this is usually driven by different research questions. However, if a single mode of action is to be diagnosed, then varying experimental parameters may cause incoherent behavioral responses (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish during toxicity assessment. This could lead to inconclusiveness of behavioral test results for use within a prospective and diagnostic risk assessment framework. To investigate the influence of these parameters, we conducted a review of existing behavioral assays to address the following two questions: (1) To what extent do varying experimental parameters influence observed effects in published behavioral test methods? (2) Is the observed behavior change (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish embryos consistent with the expected mode of action of a chemical? We compiled a set of 18 substances which are anticipated to be neuroactive. We found that behavioral changes are not only affected by chemicals but also variation in the use of experimental parameters across studies seems to have a high impact on the outcome and thus comparability between studies. Four parameters, i.e., exposure concentration, exposure duration, endpoint parameter and developmental stage were the most influential parameters. Varying combinations of these parameters caused a non-reproducible outcome for the hyperactivity expected for the organophosphates; chlorpyrifos and diazinon. We highlighted that the STC test shows a higher capacity to predict the hyperactivity of organophosphates, while PMR and LMR-L/D were more suitable to predict the hypoactivity expected for anticonvulsants. We provide a list of recommendations which, when implemented, may help to exclude the risk of bias due to experimental parameters if similar goals are desired.",

            "abstract": "Neuroactive chemicals are frequently detected in the environment. At sufficiently high concentrations or within mixtures, they could provoke neurotoxic effects and neurological diseases to organisms and humans. Fast identification of such neuroactive compounds in the environment could help in hazard assessment and risk mitigation. Behavior change is considered as an important endpoint and might be directly or indirectly connected to a neuroactive mode of action. For a fast evaluation of environmental samples and pure substances, we optimized the measurement of a behavioral endpoint in zebrafish embryos - the spontaneous tail coiling (STC). Evaluation of results is automated via the use of a workflow established with the KNIME® software. Analysis duration and developmental stage were optimized to 1 min and 25 ± 1 hpf respectively during measurement. Exposing the embryos in a group of 10 or 20 and acclimatizing for 30 min at room temperature proved to be reliable. The optimized method was used to investigate neurotoxic effects of 18 substances with different modes of action (MoA). The STC test accurately detected the effect of 8 out of 11 neuroactive substances (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon, paraoxon-methyl, abamectin, carbamazepine, propafenone and diazepam). Aldicarb and nicotine showed subtle effects which were considered to be conditional and imidacloprid showed no effect. For substances with unknown neuroactive MoA, 3 substances did not provoke any effect on the STC (pyraclostrobin, diuron and daunorubicin-hydrochloride) while 4 other substances provoked an increased STC (hexaconazole, aniline, dimethyl-sulfoxide and 3,4-dichloroaniline). Such unexpected effects indicate possible neuroactive side effects or unknown mechanisms of action that impact on the STC. In conclusion, the optimized STC parameters and the automated analysis in KNIME® indicate opportunities for the harmonization of the STC test and further development for prospective and diagnostic testing.",

            "abstract": "Risk assessment of chemicals is usually conducted for individual chemicals whereas mixtures of chemicals occur in the environment. Considering that neuroactive chemicals are a group of contaminants that dominate the environment, it is then imperative to understand the combined effects of mixtures. The commonly used models to predict mixture effects, namely concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), are thought to be suitable for mixtures of similarly or dissimilarly acting components, respectively. For mixture toxicity prediction, one important challenge is to clarify whether to group neuroactive substances based on similar mechanisms of action, e.g., same molecular target or rather similar toxicological response, e.g., hyper- or hypoactivity (effect direction). We addressed this by using the spontaneous tail coiling (STC) of zebrafish embryos, which represents the earliest observable motor activity in the developing neural network, as a model to elucidate the link between the mechanism of action and toxicological response. Our objective was to answer the following two questions: (1) Can the mixture models CA or IA be used to predict combined effects for neuroactive chemical mixtures when the components share a similar mode of action (i.e., hyper- or hypoactivity) but show different mechanism of action? (2) Will a mixture of chemicals where the components show opposing effect directions result in an antagonistic combined effect? Results indicate that mixture toxicity of chemicals such as propafenone and abamectin as well as chlorpyrifos and hexaconazole that are known to show different mechanisms of action but similar effect directions were predictable using CA and IA models. This could be interpreted with the convergence of effects on the neural level leading to either a collective activation or inhibition of synapses. We also found antagonistic effects for mixtures containing substances with opposing effect direction. Finally, we discuss how the STC may be used to amend risk assessment.",

It is also a fundamental issue for agriculture, livestock production, and aquaculture. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a metabolic theory that can provide insights for these applications, as it can accurately predict the response of an organism to changes in environmental conditions. However, DEB model parameters are typically estimated for the species using mean trait values, neglecting individual differences. With advancing data collection technologies, there is a growing need to leverage individual data to calibrate DEB models. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier methodology for estimating individual-specific DEB parameters based on techniques and principles of the standard DEB estimation procedure. Individual data is often not sufficiently complete, therefore we compliment it available data on organisms of the same species. To avoid estimation bias, we employ a hierarchical tier structure. Data is categorized into tiers, depending on how general it is. In each tier, only a subset of the parameters is estimated depending on available data. The estimation proceeds in a top-down approach, starting with the most general tier and culminating in the individual tier. Values obtained in previously estimated tiers are used as pseudo-data to anchor the parameter estimation. In this way, we obtain biologically sensible individual parameter estimates in an efficient manner. As a case study, we apply our methodology to a dataset that contains weight and feed intake measurements for 52 individuals of the Mertolenga cattle breed from two performance trials. We conclude that variability in the surface-specific maximum assimilation rate and the digestion efficiency is needed to accurately model the individual data. Furthermore, the analysis of tier parameters and individual parameter distributions uncovers differences in the diets fed to the animals.",

            "abstract": "The need for assembled existing and new toxicity data has accelerated as the amount of chemicals introduced into commerce continues to grow and regulatory mandates require safety assessments for a greater number of chemicals. To address this evolving need, the ECOTOXicology Knowledgebase (ECOTOX) was developed starting in the 1980s and is currently the world’s largest compilation of curated ecotoxicity data, providing support for assessments of chemical safety and ecological research through systematic and transparent literature review procedures. The recently released version of ECOTOX (Ver 5, www.epa.gov/ecotox) provides single‐chemical ecotoxicity data for over 12,000 chemicals and ecological species with over one million test results from over 50,000 references. Presented is an overview of ECOTOX, detailing the literature review and data curation processes within the context of current systematic review practices and discussing how recent updates improve the accessibility and reusability of data to support the assessment, management, and research of environmental chemicals. Relevant and acceptable toxicity results are identified from studies in the scientific literature, with pertinent methodological details and results extracted following well‐established controlled vocabularies and newly extracted toxicity data added quarterly to the public website. Release of ECOTOX, Ver 5, included an entirely redesigned user interface with enhanced data queries and retrieval options, visualizations to aid in data exploration, customizable outputs for export and use in external applications, and interoperability with chemical and toxicity databases and tools. This is a reliable source of curated ecological toxicity data for chemical assessments and research and continues to evolve with accessible and transparent state‐of‐the‐art practices in literature data curation and increased interoperability to other relevant resources.

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activity has affected nearly every environment on the planet. The changes that have occurred as a consequence of human activities have altered aquatic habitats by exacerbating already existing extreme environments and by introducing novel stressors. In some cases, particularly adjacent to heavily industrialized areas, these changes have introduced sufficient novel selective pressures to drive resident populations to genetically adapt in order to survive in the altered habitats, while species that were unable to adapt have been extirpated from these extreme environments. In this chapter, we aim to explore the effects of natural and novel stressors, resulting from anthropogenic activity, on fish populations. We will provide an overview of the possible multi-generational outcomes of anthropogenic contamination, as well as explore documented examples of population-wide changes that have occurred. We present case studies, including population responses to UV light, radionuclides, and metals contamination, as well as adaptational responses to persistent organic pollutants. Through this examination, we aim to not only give an overview of the existing evolutionary changes in fish populations in response to anthropogenic contamination, but also identify future areas of research on the impacts, long-term persistence, and ecological significance of these effects.",

            "abstract": "Human-induced trait change has been documented in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. These trait changes are driven by phenotypic plasticity and contemporary evolution. While efforts to manage humaninduced trait change are beginning to receive some attention, managing its ecological consequences has received virtually none. Recent work suggests that contemporary trait change can have important effects on the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Therefore, trait changes caused by human activity may be shaping ecological dynamics on a global scale. We present evidence for important ecological effects associated with human-induced trait change in a variety of study systems. These effects can occur over large spatial scales and impact system-wide processes such as trophic cascades. Importantly, the magnitude of these effects can be on par with those of traditional ecological drivers such as species presence. However, phenotypic change is not always an agent of ecological change; it can also buffer ecosystems against change. Determining the conditions under which phenotypic change may promote vs prevent ecological change should be a top research priority.",

            "abstract": "Loss of drug content during cell culture transport experiment can lead to misinterpretations in permeability analysis. This study analyses drug adsorption to various plastic containers and drug retention in cultured cells under in vitro conditions. The loss of various drugs to polystyrene tubes and well plates was compared to polypropylene and glass tubes both in deionised water and buffer solution. In cellular uptake experiments, administered drugs were obtained from cultured cells by liquid extraction. Samples were collected at various time points and drug concentrations were measured by a new HPLC–MS/MS method. Acidic drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, naproxen, probenicid, and indomethacin) showed little if any sorption to all tested materials in either water or buffer. In the case of basic drugs, substantial loss to polystyrene tubes and well plates was observed. After 4.5 h, the relative amount remaining in aqueous test solution stored in polystyrene tubes was 64.7 ± 6.8%, 38.4 ± 9.1%, 31.9 ± 6.7%, and 23.5 ± 6.1% for metoprolol, medetomidine, propranolol, and midazolam, respectively. Interestingly, there was no significant loss of drugs dissolved in buffer to any of the tested materials indicating that buffer reduced surficial interaction. The effect of drug concentration to sorption was also tested. Results indicated that the higher the concentration in the test solution the lower the proportional drug loss, suggesting that the polystyrene contained a limited amount of binding sites. Cellular uptake studies showed considerable retention of drugs in cultured cells. The amounts of absorbed drugs in cellular structures were 0.45%, 4.88%, 13.15%, 43.80%, 23.57% and 11.22% for atenolol, metoprolol, medetomidine, propranolol, midazolam, and diazepam, respectively. Overall, these findings will benefit development and validation of further in vitro drug permeation experiments.",

            "abstract": "Massive use of pesticides in conventional agriculture leads to accumulation in soil of complex mixtures, trig­ gering questions about their potential ecotoxicological risk. This study assessed cropland soils containing pesticide mixtures sampled from conventional and organic farming systems at La Cage and Mons, France. The conventional agricultural field soils contained more pesticide residues (11 and 17 versus 3 and 11, respectively) and at higher concentrations than soils from organic fields (mean 6.6 and 10.5 versus 0.2 and 0.6 μg kg− 1, respectively), including systemic insecticides belonging to neonicotinoids, carbamate herbicides and broadspectrum fungicides mostly from the azole family. A risk quotient (RQi) approach evaluated the toxicity of the pesticide mixtures in soil, assuming concentration addition. Based on measured concentrations, both conven­ tional agricultural soils posed high risks to soil invertebrates, especially due to the presence of epoxiconazole and imidacloprid, whereas soils under organic farming showed negligible to medium risk. To confirm the outcome of the risk assessment, toxicity of the soils was determined in bioassays following standardized test guidelines with seven representative non-target invertebrates: earthworms (Eisenia andrei, Lumbricus rubellus, Aporrectodea cal­ iginosa), enchytraeids (Enchytraeus crypticus), Collembola (Folsomia candida), oribatid mites (Oppia nitens), and snails (Cantareus aspersus). Collembola and enchytraeid survival and reproduction and land snail growth were significantly lower in soils from conventional compared to organic agriculture. The earthworms displayed different responses: L. rubellus showed higher mortality on soils from conventional agriculture and large body mass loss in all field soils, E. andrei showed considerable mass loss and strongly reduced reproduction, and A. caliginosa showed significantly reduced acetylcholinesterase activity in soils from conventional agriculture. The oribatid mites did not show consistent differences between organic and conventional farming soils. These results highlight that conventional agricultural practices pose a high risk for soil invertebrates and may threaten soil functionality, likely due to additive or synergistic “cocktail effects”.",

            "abstract": "An integrate study regarding the occurrence and fate of eleven organophosphate esters (OPEs) was conducted at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the area of Thessaloniki, Greece. Both plants employed conven­ tional activated sludge process whereas as last treatment step the first unit use chlorination and the second one ozonation. OPEs were determined in dissolved fraction, total suspended solids and sludge from various treatment stages of WWTPs. Tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TClPP) and tri­ phenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) were the most abundant compounds in influent and treated ef∑ fluent. Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) was also abundant in suspended solids and sludge. Total concentrations of 11OPEs ranged from 2144 to 9743 ng L− 1 in influents, 1237–2909 ng L− 1 in effluents and 3332–14294 ng g− 1 dw in sludge. Removal rates from 55% to 80% were observed for most OPEs, whereas chlorinated OPEs, especially for tris(2chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) exhibited low removal efficiency. Mass balance analysis showed that biodegra­ dation was the dominant removal mechanism contributing up to 85%. Sorption onto sludge was also relevant removal pathway for most compounds. Emissions of OPEs through effluents and sludge did not pose considerable risk to the aquatic and terrestrial environment.",

            "abstract": "Information about acute fish toxicity is routinely required in many jurisdictions for environmental risk assessment of chemicals. This information is typically obtained using a 96-hour juvenile fish test for lethality according to OECD test guideline (TG) 203 or equivalent regional guidelines. However, TG 203 has never been validated using criteria currently required for new test methods including alternative methods. Characterization of the practicality and validity of TG 203 is important to provide a benchmark for alternative methods. This contribution systematically summarizes the available knowledge about limitations and uncertainties of TG 203, based on methodological, statistical, and biological considerations. Uncertainties stem from the historic flexibility (e.g. use of a broad range of species) and constraints of the basic test design (e.g., no replication). Other sources of uncertainty arise from environmental safety extrapolation based on TG 203 data. Environmental extrapolation models, combined with data from alternative methods, including mechanistic indicators of toxicity, may provide at least the same level of environmental protection. Yet, most importantly the 3R advantages of alternative methods allow a better standardization, characterization and an improved basic study design. This can enhance data reliability and thus facilitate the comparison of chemical toxicity, as well as the environmental classifications and prediction of no-effect concentrations of chemicals. Combined with the 3R gains and the potential for higher throughput, a reliable assessment of more chemicals can be achieved, leading to improved environmental protection.",

            "abstract": "Lumbricus terrestris, an abundant and widespread earthworm of temperate regions, plays an important role in soil structure and organic matter turnover, especially in unplowed fields. The prediction of earthworm density is important to accurately assess the role they are playing in soil quality. The population dynamics of L. terrestris have been mainly studied under grassland conditions but little effort has been dedicated to predicting such dynamics in cultivated soils. This paper presents a new model, WORMDYN that simulates the population dynamics of L. terrestris in terms of density. WORMDYN is a stochastic stage-based Leslie matrix model which accounts for vertical migrations. In the model, the earthworm population is divided into four developmental stages (cocoons, juveniles, sub-adults, and adults) and life cycle parameters depend on soil temperature and water content. The model parameters were estimated from the available literature. Experiments were carried out in 2006 and 2007 in plowed and surface tilled plots (Grignon, France) to assess the accuracy of the model predictions of L. terrestris density. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the WORMDYN predictions ranged from 0.5 to 19.9 individuals m−2 in 2006 and from 0.4 to 40.5 individuals −2 in 2007, depending on the type of soil tillage, the time of year and the developmental stage. The RMSE values of WORMDYN were compared to RMSE values obtained for predictions directly derived from density measurements and from the model of [Svendsen, T.S., Hansen, P.E., Sommer, C., Martinussen, T., Grønvold, J., Holter, P., 2005. Life history characteristics of Lumbricus terrestris and effects of the veterinary antiparasitic compounds ivermectin and fenbendazole. Soil Biol. Biochem. 37, 927–936]. In 2006, WORMDYN performed better for all developmental stages except for adults. In 2007, WORMDYN performed better for juvenile, adult, and total populations in the plowed plot, but the RMSE values of WORMDYN were almost always higher than the values obtained for the other two series of predictions for the unplowed plot. The relatively high RMSE values obtained in 2007 were probably due to some intrinsic factors regulating the population which were not taken into account by the model, like density-dependence and/or competition for food and space. It may also be due to inaccurate estimation of parameter values. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the parameters which should be estimated with a higher precision in order to improve the predictive capabilities of the model. The results showed that the most important parameters are the survival rate of juveniles and the fecundity of adults.",

            "abstract": "Pesticide risk assessments include experiments designed to measure the effect of pesticides on earthworms using the Eisenia fetida fetida or Eisenia fetida andrei species. There is no clear consensus in the literature on the sensitivity of different earthworm species to pesticides. We performed a meta-analysis on the sensitivity of several earthworm species to pesticides to determine the most sensitive species, and to discuss their suitability for European homologation tests. A dataset including median lethal dose (LC50) values reported in 44 experimental treatments was constructed and then analyzed in order to compare the sensitivity levels of E. fetida with that of other earthworm species. Results showed that LC50 values reported for Lumbricus terrestris and Aporrectodea caliginosa were on average significantly lower than for E. fetida. Considering the relatively high LC50 values reported for E. fetida and the absence of this species from zones where pesticides are usually applied, the relevance of using E. fetida for pesticide homologation tests is questionable and we advise risk assessors to use A. caliginosa as model species. A new protocol based on this species could be proposed for European homologation tests but its implementation will require the definition of a new standard and take time. In the meantime, the results obtained with E. fetida should be interpreted with caution taking into account the low sensitivity of this species. Our study illustrates the value of the meta-analysis approach for comparing the sensitivity of different earthworm species to pesticides. It would be useful to extend the dataset presented in this paper in order to analyze the sensitivity of other aquatic or terrestrial organism groups used for pesticide homologation or ecotoxicology tests.",

            "abstract": "Earthworms provide key soil functions that favour many positive ecosystem services. These services are important for agroecosystem sustainability but can be degraded by intensive cultural practices such as use of pesticides. Many literature reports have investigated the effect of pesticides on earthworms. Here, we review those reports to assess the relevance of the indicators of earthworm response to pesticides, to assess their sensitivity to pesticides, and to highlight the remaining knowledge gaps. We focus on European earthworm species and products authorised in Europe, excluding natural compounds and metals. We consider different organisation levels: the infra-individual level (gene expression and physiology), the individual and population levels (life-history traits, population density and behaviour) and the community level: community biomass and density. Our analysis shows that earthworms are impacted by pesticides at all organisation levels. For example, pesticides disrupt enzymatic activities, increase individual mortality, decrease fecundity and growth, change individual behaviour such as feeding rate and decrease the overall community biomass and density.",

            "abstract": "Pesticides may harm soil organisms such as earthworms and enchytraeids, but knowledge is lacking on their relative sensitivity to these chemicals and the consequences on soil functions. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of exposure to a commercial fungicide formulation (Swing® Gold, containing dimoxystrobin and epoxiconazole) on the function of earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and enchytraeids (Enchytraeus buchholzi) in soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization. The soil organisms were incubated alone and together in a 26-day laboratory experiment. At the recommended field rate, the fungicide induced a decrease in the SOM mineralization and a delay in the maximum daily CO2 emissions compared to the control soil without fungicide. Soil fauna also influenced SOM mineralization with a higher cumulated CO2 release after 26 days in the control soil with earthworms (by 21%) than without fauna. When both earthworms and enchytraeids were present, SOM mineralization did not increase, and there was a negative effect on earthworm weight gain. Finally, an alteration of fauna influence with treatment was observed from day 19, meaning that the effect of fauna on SOM mineralization changed with fungicide treatment. Earthworms no longer promoted SOM mineralization when fungicide was present at three-fold the recommended field rate. The effects of enchytraeids on SOM mineralization were similar with and without fungicide exposure. This study underlines the importance of considering the relative sensitivity of soil organisms to environmental factors and interactions between them when assessing soil functioning.",

            "abstract": "Critical knowledge gaps about environmental fate and unintentional effects of currently used pesticides (CUPs) hamper the understanding and mitigation of their global impacts on ecological processes. We investigated the exposure of earthworms to 31 multiclass CUPs in an arable landscape in France. We highlighted the presence of at least one pesticide in all soils (n=180) and 92% of earthworms (n=155) both in treated crops and nontreated habitats (hedgerows, grasslands, and cereals under organic farming). Mixtures of at least one insecticide, one herbicide, and one fungicide ($>$ limit of quantification) contaminated 90% of soils and 54% of earthworms at levels that could endanger these nontarget beneficial soil organisms. A high risk of chronic toxicity to earthworms was found (46% of samples) both in treated winter cereals and nontreated habitats considered as refuges. This may alter biodiversity, hinder recovery, and impair ecosystem functions. These results provide essential insights for sustainable agriculture and CUP regulation, and highlight the potential of pesticides as agents of global change.",

            "abstract": "The Aporrectodea caliginosa species complex includes the most abundant earthworms in grasslands and agricultural ecosystems of the Paleartic region. Historically this complex consisted of the following taxa: A. caliginosa s.s. Savigny, 1826, A. trapezoides Dugés (1828), A. tuberculata (Eisen, 1874), and A. nocturna Evans (1946). These four taxa are morphologically very similar and difficult to differentiate because of their morphological variability. Consequently, their taxonomic status and their phylogenetic relationships have been a matter of discussion for more than a century. To study these questions, we sequenced the COII (686 bp), 12S (362 bp), 16S (1200 bp), ND1 (917 bp), and tRNAsAsn-Asp-Val-Leu-Ala-Ser-Leu (402 bp) mitochondrial and 28S (809 bp) nuclear gene regions for 85 European earthworms from 27 different localities belonging to the A. caliginosa species complex and four outgroup taxa. DNA sequences were analyzed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches of phylogenetic inference. The resulting trees were combined with morphological, ecological, and genomic evidence to test species boundaries (i.e., integrative approach). Our molecular analyses showed that A. caliginosa s.s. and A. tuberculata form a sister clade to A. trapezoides, A. longa, and A. nocturna, which indicates that A. longa is part of the A. caliginosa species complex. We confirm the species status of all these taxa and identify two hitherto unrecognized Aporrectodea species in Corsica (France). Moreover our analyses also showed the presence of highly divergent lineages within A. caliginosa, A. trapezoides, and A. longa, suggesting the existence of cryptic diversity within these taxa.",

            "abstract": "We present models to link feeding with growth, emergence, and reproduction of the midge Chironomus riparius. These models are based on assumptions about the biology of this species and distinguish between males and females. The assumptions are the isomorphism of the chironomidae, the fact that much more energy is used for growth than for maintenance, and the existence of a maximum length for male and female larvae that does not depend on food availability. We supported our assumptions by experimental data and estimated the parameters of the model. We then successfully predicted the length pattern of 2-d-old larvae exposed in an artificial sediment to different feeding levels with different starting densities and also linked emergence time and growth pattern. We found our model to be consistent with data from another study and another species (Chironomus plumosus). As for reproduction, the mean number of eggs per mass was described as a linear function of feeding quantity. Our models could be used in sediment risk assessment to choose feeding level, to build effects models, or to predict the effects of toxicants at the population level.",

            "abstract": "The fields of behavioral ecology, conservation science, and environmental toxicology individually aim to protect and manage the conservation of wildlife in response to anthropogenic stressors, including widespread anthropogenic pollution. Although great emphasis in the field of toxicology has been placed on understanding how single pollutants affect survival, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach that includes behavioral ecology is essential to address how anthropogenic compounds are a risk for the survival of species and populations in an increasingly polluted world. We provide an integrative framework for behavioral ecotoxicology using Tinbergen’s four postulates (causation and mechanism, development and ontogeny, function and fitness, and evolutionary history and phylogenetic patterns). The aims of this review are: 1) to promote an integrative view and re-define the field of integrative behavioral ecotoxicology; 2) to demonstrate how studying ecotoxicology can promote behavior research; and 3) to identify areas of behavioral ecotoxicology that require further attention to promote the integration and growth of the field.",

            "abstract": "Earthworm species interact with each other in soils, but these interactions are poorly understood. Moreover, these key soil organisms are influenced by abiotic soil components such as organic matter. Here, we investigated the influence of Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea nocturna, two earthworm species from different ecological categories, on the incorporation of organic matter, reproduction and weight change of the endogeic Aporrectodea caliginosa. Two different types of organic matter i) a compost and ii) a fresh refined organic material, both from green waste, were used. Earthworm parameters were monitored during an 8-weeks laboratory experiment using a vineyard soil in order to identify positive and negative interactions between species. Irrespective of species, earthworms interacted preferentially with smaller particles, more decomposed and with a lower C/N ratio. For an equivalent earthworm biomass, similar amount of green compost was incorporated by A. caliginosa and A. nocturna. However, A. chlorotica did not bury this material. The green compost increased the reproduction rate of A. caliginosa when associated to A. chlorotica. Moreover, the association with the epi-anecic A. nocturna increased the reproduction rate of A. caliginosa with the addition of refined organic matter (fresh material). Furthermore, in both earthworm associations, the weight loss of A. caliginosa was reduced by the addition of green compost to the soil surface. These results highlight the importance of earthworm interactions in maintaining populations, and emphasized the need of field studies to confirm these interactions, particularly in the context of soil fertility where organic amendments are often applied.",

            "abstract": "In the context of global changes, fish are increasingly exposed to multiple stressors that have cascading effects from molecules to the whole individual, thereby affecting wild fish populations through selective processes. In this review, we synthetize recent advances in molecular biology and evolutionary biology to outline some potentially important effects of stressors on fish across biological levels. Given the burgeoning literature, we highlight four promising avenues of research. First, (1) the exposure to multiple stressors can lead to unexpected synergistic or antagonistic effects, which should be better taken into account to improve our predictions of the effects of actual and future human activities on aquatic organisms. Second, (2) we argue that such interactive effects might be due to switches in energy metabolism leading to threshold effects. Under multiple stress exposure, fish could switch from a “compensation” strategy, i.e. a reallocation of energy to defenses and repair to a “conservation” strategy, i.e. blocking of stress responses leading to strong deleterious effects and high mortality. Third, (3) this could have cascading effects on fish survival and population persistence but multiscale studies are still rare. We propose emerging tools merging different levels of biological organization to better predict population resilience under multiple stressors. Fourth (4), there are strong variations in sensitivity among populations, which might arise from transgenerational effects of stressors through plastic, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms. This can lead to local adaptation or maladaptation, with strong impacts on the evolutionary trajectories of wild fish populations. With this review, we hope to encourage future research to bridge the gap between molecular ecology, ecotoxicology and evolutionary biology to better understand the evolution of responses of fishes to current and future multiple stressors in the context of global changes.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the biological relevance of variance components estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based mixed-effects models is not straightforward. Variance estimates are constrained to be greater than zero and their posterior distributions are often asymmetric. Different measures of central tendency for these distributions can therefore vary widely, and credible intervals cannot overlap zero, making it difficult to assess the size and statistical support for among-group variance. Statistical support is often assessed through visual inspection of the whole posterior distribution and so relies on subjective decisions for interpretation. We use simulations to demonstrate the difficulties of summarizing the posterior distributions of variance estimates from MCMC-based models. We then describe different methods for generating the expected null distribution (i.e. a distribution of effect sizes that would be obtained if there was no among-group variance) that can be used to aid in the interpretation of variance estimates. Through comparing commonly used summary statistics of posterior distributions of variance components, we show that the posterior median is predominantly the least biased. We further show how null distributions can be used to derive a p-value that provides complementary information to the commonly presented measures of central tendency and uncertainty. Finally, we show how these p-values facilitate the implementation of power analyses within an MCMC framework. The use of null distributions for variance components can aid study design and the interpretation of results from MCMC-based models. We hope that this manuscript will make empiricists using mixed models think more carefully about their results, what descriptive statistics they present and what inference they can make.",

            "abstract": "Environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals is global, substantially altering crucial behaviours in animals and impacting on their reproduction and survival. A key question is whether the consequences of these pollutants extend beyond mean behavioural changes, restraining differences in behaviour between individuals. In a controlled, two-year, multigenerational experiment with independent mesocosm populations, we exposed guppies ( Poecilia reticulata ) to environmentally realistic levels of the ubiquitous pollutant fluoxetine (Prozac). Fish (unexposed: n = 59, low fluoxetine: n = 57, high fluoxetine: n = 58) were repeatedly assayed on four separate occasions for activity and risk-taking behaviour. Fluoxetine homogenized individuals’ activity, with individual variation in populations exposed to even low concentrations falling to less than half that in unexposed populations. To understand the proximate mechanism underlying these changes, we tested the relative contribution of variation within and between individuals to the overall decline in individual variation. We found strong evidence that fluoxetine erodes variation in activity between but not within individuals, revealing the hidden consequences of a ubiquitous contaminant on phenotypic variation in fish—likely to impair adaptive potential to environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Environmental contamination by pharmaceuticals is global, substantially altering crucial behaviours in animals and impacting on their reproduction and survival. A key question is whether the consequences of these pollutants extend beyond mean behavioural changes, restraining differences in behaviour between individuals. In a controlled, two-year, multigenerational experiment with independent mesocosm populations, we exposed guppies ( Poecilia reticulata ) to environmentally realistic levels of the ubiquitous pollutant fluoxetine (Prozac). Fish (unexposed: n = 59, low fluoxetine: n = 57, high fluoxetine: n = 58) were repeatedly assayed on four separate occasions for activity and risk-taking behaviour. Fluoxetine homogenized individuals’ activity, with individual variation in populations exposed to even low concentrations falling to less than half that in unexposed populations. To understand the proximate mechanism underlying these changes, we tested the relative contribution of variation within and between individuals to the overall decline in individual variation. We found strong evidence that fluoxetine erodes variation in activity between but not within individuals, revealing the hidden consequences of a ubiquitous contaminant on phenotypic variation in fish—likely to impair adaptive potential to environmental change.",

            "abstract": "The global rise of pharmaceutical contaminants in the aquatic environment poses a serious threat to ecological and evolutionary processes. Studies have traditionally focused on the collateral (average) effects of psychoactive pollutants on ecologically relevant behaviors of wildlife, often neglecting effects among and within individuals, and whether they differ between males and females. We tested whether psychoactive pollutants have sex-specific effects on behavioral individuality and plasticity in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), a freshwater species that inhabits contaminated waterways in the wild. Fish were exposed to fluoxetine (Prozac) for 2 years across multiple generations before their activity and stress-related behavior were repeatedly assayed. Using a Bayesian statistical approach that partitions the effects among and within individuals, we found that males—but not females—in fluoxetine-exposed populations differed less from each other in their behavior (lower behavioral individuality) than unexposed males. In sharp contrast, effects on behavioral plasticity were observed in females—but not in males—whereby exposure to even low levels of fluoxetine resulted in a substantial decrease (activity) and increase (freezing behavior) in the behavioral plasticity of females. Our evidence reveals that psychoactive pollution has sex-specific effects on the individual behavior of fish, suggesting that males and females might not be equally vulnerable to global pollutants.",

The Scientific Outcome further develops and substantiates the conclusions of the Synopsis, summarizes the emerging state of knowledge involving climate change and biodiversity with the objective to inform decision making and highlight options for action, and to identify knowledge gaps to be filled by scientific research. The Scientific Outcome includes seven sections, the references outlining the evidence reviewed within those sections and the report glossary.",

Dynamic Energy and Mass Budgets in Biological Systems. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 424 pp.) has been adapted to describe the dynamics of growth and reproduction of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared in different areas under conditions ranging from controlled to natural. The values of the model parameters were estimated from available physiological data and from published information. The sets of data used to validate the model came from three long-term growth experiments ($>$ 5 months) performed on Pacific oysters reared under different conditions of food and environment. The forcing variables were temperature and phytoplankton densities, the latter being assessed from in vivo fluorescence and chlorophyll-a concentration measurement. The successful validation of the model on the three data sets demonstrated its ability to capture the dynamics of the energy budget in the Pacific oyster in various environments with the same set of parameters. The only parameter that varied between simulations was the half-saturation coefficient (XK), because of a different diet composition between the three environments under test. The model successfully reproduced quantitatively the growth and reproduction and the timing of spawning. These first simulation data led us to propose several promising perspectives of application for this model in shellfish ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Abstract The use of the free ion approach to quantify the toxic effects of Cd and Ni to the earthworms Lumbricus rubellus and Aporrectodea longa exposed in soils of different types was explored. Median lethal concentration (LC50) of Cd (expressed as the total concentration in soil) varied by approximately 11‐fold and 28‐fold for L. rubellus and A. longa , respectively. For Ni, these values were 50‐fold and 38‐fold, respectively. For the 2 earthworm species, no significant influence of cations (H + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + , and Na + ) on Cd 2+ toxicity was observed, while Mg 2+ was found to significantly alleviate Ni 2+ toxicity. The free ion activity model, which is a special case of the free ion approach with no impact of cations, sufficiently described the variability in Cd 2+ toxicity across soils but failed in predicting Ni 2+ toxicity. The free ion approach, in which the protective effects of Mg 2+ were included, explained 89% and 84% of the variations in LC50{Ni 2+ } (expressed as free ion activity) for L. rubellus (log LC50{Ni 2+ } = 1.18log{Mg 2+ }−0.52) and A. longa (log LC50{Ni 2+ } = 0.51log{Mg 2+ }−2.16), respectively. Prediction error was within a factor of 2 for both Cd 2+ and Ni 2+ toxicity, indicating the applicability of the free ion approach for predicting toxicity of these 2 metals. Although extrapolation of the free ion approach across metals still needs more research efforts, this approach, as an alternative to the biotic ligand model, provides a feasible framework for site‐specific risk assessment.

The simple but conservative initial Tier 1 risk assessment considers a range of worst‐case assumptions. In contrast, the higher‐tier assessment focuses on specific conditions tested in the corresponding field study. Effect modeling, such as toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic (TKTD) modeling, is considered a promising future tool to address uncertainties in soil risk assessment, such as extrapolation to different ecological, pedo‐climatical, or agronomical situations, or to serve as an intermediate tier for potential refinement of the risk assessment. For the implementation of TKTD modeling in soil organism risk assessment, data on earthworm growth and reproduction over time are required, which are not provided by the standard Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) 222 laboratory test. The underlying study with carbendazim presents a new earthworm cocoon test design, based on the OECD 222 test, to provide the necessary data as input for TKTD modeling. This proposed test design involves destructive samplings at days 7, 14, 21, and 28, enabling the determination of growth, cocoon number, and the number of juveniles hatched per cocoon in 7‐day intervals. The new cocoon test allowed the disentanglement of the toxic effect of carbendazim in earthworms: At the highest concentration prominent effects on growth and reproductive output were observed, and the number of cocoons was significantly reduced compared to control. The results highlighted different physiological modes of action: effect on growth via higher maintenance costs as a primary mode of action as well as a reduced number of cocoons (effect on reproduction) and a lower number of juveniles hatching from each cocoon (hazard during oogenesis) as a secondary mode of action. We provide an example of how this new test’s data can be used to feed a dynamic energy budget theory–TKTD model of Eisenia fetida.

This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, explorationavoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.",

            "abstract": "The field of ecotoxicology is experiencing a surge in attention among ecologists as we gain a deeper appreciation for how contaminants can impact natural ecosystems. This interest is particularly strong in aquatic systems where many non-target organisms experience pesticides. In this article, we assess how pesticides affect freshwater systems by applying the conceptual framework of density- and trait-mediated indirect effects from the field of basic ecology. We demonstrate the utility of this framework for understanding the conditions under which pesticides affect species interactions, communities and ecosystems. Through the integration of laboratory toxicity tests and this ecological framework, ecotoxicologists should be better able to identify the mechanisms through which pesticides affect communities and ecosystems. We also identify several areas of research that are in critical need of empirical attention including synergistic effects between pesticides and natural stressors, the importance of pesticides on community assembly via habitat preferences and oviposition effects, the timing and frequency of pesticide applications, pesticide effects on population dynamics, the evolution of pesticide resistance in non-target organisms and ecosystem recovery. With this knowledge, one can improve upon management decisions and help protect nontarget species that are of conservation concern.",

            "abstract": "In the last years many efforts were made to transform standardized algal test protocols into low-cost microplate assays. While advantages were pointed out frequently, limitations are not systematically addressed, thus hindering a widespread utilisation. In this study a group of organic substances with a wide distribution of volatility (log KAW from À6.53 to À2.13) and lipophilicity (log KOW from 1.26 to 4.92) was investigated with respect to the influence of these physicochemical properties on their algal toxicity in different assays. Therefore the EC50 values were determined with a microplate assay based on ISO 8692 protocol and the results were compared with those of an established algal growth inhibition test conducted in air tight glass vessels. Using the ratio of the EC50 values, a clear connection between biological response and volatility as well as lipophilicity of test substances could be detected. Chemicals with a log KOW higher than 3 or a Henry coefficient log KAW higher than À4 were identified as less effective in the microplate assay than in the comparative assay. The loss in nominal concentration due to physicochemical properties could be shown to contribute to this using HPLC analysis. Consequently, when using microplate assay’s one should be aware that lipophilic and volatile chemicals might be underestimated in their toxicity, which could be indicated from evaluating related physicochemical properties modelled from structural information prior to an experimental investigation.",

            "abstract": "Declines in European bird populations are reported for decades but the direct effect of major anthropogenic pressures on such declines remains unquantified. Causal relationships between pressures and bird population responses are difficult to identify as pressures interact at different spatial scales and responses vary among species. Here, we uncover direct relationships between population time-series of 170 common bird species, monitored at more than 20,000 sites in 28 European countries, over 37 y, and four widespread anthropogenic pressures: agricultural intensification, change in forest cover, urbanisation and temperature change over the last decades. We quantify the influence of each pressure on population time-series and its importance relative to other pressures, and we identify traits of most affected species. We find that agricultural intensification, in particular pesticides and fertiliser use, is the main pressure for most bird population declines, especially for invertebrate feeders. Responses to changes in forest cover, urbanisation and temperature are more species-specific. Specifically, forest cover is associated with a positive effect and growing urbanisation with a negative effect on population dynamics, while temperature change has an effect on the dynamics of a large number of bird populations, the magnitude and direction of which depend on species’ thermal preferences. Our results not only confirm the pervasive and strong effects of anthropogenic pressures on common breeding birds, but quantify the relative strength of these effects stressing the urgent need for transformative changes in the way of inhabiting the world in European countries, if bird populations shall have a chance of recovering.",

            "abstract": "Declines in European bird populations are reported for decades but the direct effect of major anthropogenic pressures on such declines remains unquantified. Causal relationships between pressures and bird population responses are difficult to identify as pressures interact at different spatial scales and responses vary among species. Here, we uncover direct relationships between population time-series of 170 common bird species, monitored at more than 20,000 sites in 28 European countries, over 37 y, and four widespread anthropogenic pressures: agricultural intensification, change in forest cover, urbanisation and temperature change over the last decades. We quantify the influence of each pressure on population time-series and its importance relative to other pressures, and we identify traits of most affected species. We find that agricultural intensification, in particular pesticides and fertiliser use, is the main pressure for most bird population declines, especially for invertebrate feeders. Responses to changes in forest cover, urbanisation and temperature are more species-specific. Specifically, forest cover is associated with a positive effect and growing urbanisation with a negative effect on population dynamics, while temperature change has an effect on the dynamics of a large number of bird populations, the magnitude and direction of which depend on species’ thermal preferences. Our results not only confirm the pervasive and strong effects of anthropogenic pressures on common breeding birds, but quantify the relative strength of these effects stressing the urgent need for transformative changes in the way of inhabiting the world in European countries, if bird populations shall have a chance of recovering.",

            "abstract": "This study reviews dose–response models that are used in ecotoxicology. The focus lies on clarification of differences and similarities between models, and as a side effect, their different guises in ecotoxicology are unravelled. A look at frequently used dose–response models reveals major discrepancies, among other things in naming conventions. Therefore, there is a need for a unified view on dose–response modeling in order to improve the understanding of it and to facilitate communication and comparison of findings across studies, thus realizing its full potential. This study attempts to establish a general framework that encompasses most dose–response models that are of interest to ecotoxicologists in practice. The framework includes commonly used models such as the log-logistic and Weibull models, but also features entire suites of models as found in various guidance documents. An outline on how the proposed framework can be implemented in statistical software systems is also provided. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:220–229.",

            "abstract": "Recent recognition that ecological and evolutionary processes can operate on similar timescales has led to a rapid increase in theoretical and empirical studies on eco-evolutionary dynamics. Progress in the fields of evolutionary biology, genomics and ecology is greatly enhancing our understanding of rapid adaptive processes, the predictability of adaptation and the genetics of ecologically important traits. However, progress in these fields has proceeded largely independently of one another. In an attempt to better integrate these fields, the centre for “Adaptation to a Changing Environment” organized a conference entitled “The genomic basis of eco-evolutionary change” and brought together experts in ecological genomics and eco-evolutionary dynamics. In this review, we use the work of the invited speakers to summarize eco-evolutionary dynamics and discuss how they are relevant for understanding and predicting responses to contemporary environmental change. Then, we show how recent advances in genomics are contributing to our understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. Finally, we highlight the gaps in our understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics and recommend future avenues of research in eco-evolutionary dynamics.",

The present study aimed to assess the sensitivity of Palaemon serratus NAGase activity to a set of compounds of diverse chemical families in the context of in vitro exposures. Compounds representing different chemical families were selected according to their abundance, impact in the environment, and relevance as disruptors of the molting process. In a first step, four solvents (dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO], methanol, acetone, and ethanol) were tested to determine their suitability to dissolve hydrophobic compounds without affecting NAGase activity. Exclusively, ethanol had no effect on enzyme activity and on the integrity of the proteins present in the enzyme extract. The 18 other compounds were tested and four of these compounds, pentoxifylline, fenoxycarb, dithiocarbamate, and RH5849, showed a specific alteration on the activity of NAGase, without affecting the protein content. However, cadmium, zinc, and glyphosate showed a nonspecific alteration, affecting both the enzyme activity and the proteins, whereas ibuprofen exclusively altered the protein content. Finally, 10 of the 22 tested compounds (including DMSO, acetone, and methanol) showed a direct alteration of NAGase activity. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;42:846–858. © 2023 SETAC",

With their broad diet, generalist predators represent key nodes in the structure of many food webs and they contribute substantially to ecosystem services such as biological pest control. However, until recently it has been difficult to empirically assess food web structure with generalist predators. We utilized DNA-based molecular gut-content analyses to assess the prey use of a set of generalist invertebrate predator species common in temperate agricultural fields. We investigated the degree of specialization of predator-prey food webs at two key stages of the cropping season and analysed the link temperature of different trophic links, to identify non-random predation. We found a low level of specialization in our food webs, and identified warm and cool links which may result from active prey choice or avoidance. We also found a within-season variation in interaction strength between predators and aphid pests which differed among predator species. Our results show a high time-specific functional redundancy of the predator community, but also suggest temporally complementary prey choice due to within-season succession of some predator species.",

            "abstract": "Among the handful of studies on the behavioural effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), only a few have set out to disentangle the mechanisms underpinning behavioural changes. In fish, previous studies have shown that both visual and chemical cues play an important role in mate choice. As such, contaminant-induced changes in either transmission or perception of mate choice cues could have direct implications for individual’s fitness. One widespread contaminant of environmental concern is 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen used in the contraceptive pill. Here, we investigated the impacts of EE2 exposure (28 days; measured concentration 14 ng/L) on visual and chemical communication in wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Using a standard dichotomous mate choice assay, we first gave individual males (either control or EE2-exposed) the opportunity to court two size-matched females (one control and one EE2-exposed) using only visual cues. We then introduced chemical cues of females (control and EE2-exposed) to the trial tank. We found that there was no significant effect of EE2-treatment on total time males spent associating with the females, when given only visual cues. There was, however, a significant effect on male courtship behaviour, with both control and EE2-exposed males spending more time performing “sigmoid” displays towards the visual cues of control females compared to EE2-exposed females. When males were presented with both visual and chemical female cues simultaneously, we found that males spent more time courting control females that were paired with EE2-chemical cues. Not only does our study uncover a previously unknown behavioural impact of EE2-exposure on chemical cues, but demonstrates that EE2-exposure can exert complex effects on visual and chemical communication in a mate choice context. Finally, we contribute to the discussion of intraspecific variability by providing data on the potential trade-offs underpinning contaminant-induced behavioural changes.",

            "abstract": "Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world’s insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.",

            "abstract": "Wild populations must continuously respond to environmental changes or they risk extinction. Those responses can be measured as phenotypic rates of change, which can allow us to predict contemporary adaptive responses, some of which are evolutionary. About two decades ago, a database of phenotypic rates of change in wild populations was compiled. Since then, researchers have used (and expanded) this database to examine phenotypic responses to specific types of human disturbance. Here, we update the database by adding 5675 new estimates of phenotypic change. Using this newer version of the data base, now containing 7338 estimates of phenotypic change, we revisit the conclusions of four published articles. We then synthesize the expanded database to compare rates of change across different types of human disturbance. Analyses of this expanded database suggest that: (i) a small absolute difference in rates of change exists between human disturbed and natural populations, (ii) harvesting by humans results in higher rates of change than other types of disturbance, (iii) introduced populations have increased rates of change, and (iv) body size does not increase through time. Thus, findings from earlier analyses have largely held­up in analyses of our new database that encompass a much larger breadth of species, traits, and human disturbances. Lastly, we use new analyses to explore how various types of human disturbances affect rates of phenotypic change, and we call for this database to serve as a steppingstone for further analyses to understand patterns of contemporary phenotypic change.",

            "abstract": "Most studies assessing rates of phenotypic change focus on population mean trait values, whereas a largely overlooked additional component is changes in population trait variation. Theoretically, eco-evolutionary dynamics mediated by such changes in trait variation could be as important as those mediated by changes in trait means. To date, however, no study has comprehensively summarised how phenotypic variation is changing in contemporary populations. Here, we explore four questions using a large database: How do changes in trait variances compare to changes in trait means? Do different human disturbances have different effects on trait variance? Do different trait types have different effects on changes in trait variance? Do studies that established a genetic basis for trait change show different patterns from those that did not? We find that changes in variation are typically small; yet we also see some very large changes associated with particular disturbances or trait types. We close by interpreting and discussing the implications of our findings in the context of eco-evolutionary studies.",

We investigated the effects of different earthworm and enchytraeid species and their interaction on the consumption and decomposition of barley straw and cattle manure, commonly used as organic amendments in agriculture. In total, 55 microcosms were set up covering the following treatments: straw of three length classes (2.5 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm), two length classes (2.5 cm, 10 cm) and cattle manure which were offered to earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris, Aporrectodea caliginosa); enchytraeids (Enchytraeus crypticus, Enchytraeus christenseni); mixed earthworms and enchytraeids (L. terrestris, A. caliginosa, E. crypticus, E. christenseni); no animals (control). After 45 days of dark incubation at 15ºC the consumption rate, soil microbial biomass, pH, nitrogen (N-NH4+, N-NO3-, Nt), and organic carbon were measured. The results indicated that mixed faunal treatments revealed the highest consumption rate. Short straw was consumed preferentially in all treatments. Earthworms increased microbial biomass and contents of N-NO3and N-NH4+. In the enchytraeid treatments soil microbial biomass and organic carbon were lower compared with control, while soil nitrate was lowest when straw was used as organic source. Soil fauna in the mixed treatment reduced soil microbial biomass, N-NO3- and soil organic carbon content. It is concluded that earthworm-enchytraeid-interactions might have important impacts on soil fertility.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystems are strongly influenced by multiple anthropogenic stressors, including a wide range of chemicals and their mixtures. Studies on the effects of multiple stressors have largely focussed on nonchemical stressors, whereas studies on chemical mixtures have largely ignored other stressors. However, both research areas face similar challenges and require similar tools and methods to predict the joint effects of chemicals or nonchemical stressors, and frameworks to integrate multiple chemical and nonchemical stressors are missing. We provide an overview of the research paradigms, tools, and methods commonly used in multiple stressor and chemical mixture research and discuss potential domains of crossfertilization and joint challenges. First, we compare the general paradigms of ecotoxicology and (applied) ecology to explain the historical divide. Subsequently, we compare methods and approaches for the identification of interactions, stressor characterization, and designing experiments. We suggest that both multiple stressor and chemical mixture research are too focused on interactions and would benefit from integration regarding null model selection. Stressor characterization is typically more costly for chemical mixtures. While for chemical mixtures comprehensive classification systems at suborganismal level have been developed, recent classification systems for multiple stressors account for environmental context. Both research areas suffer from rather simplified experimental designs that focus on only a limited number of stressors, chemicals, and treatments. We discuss concepts that can guide more realistic designs capturing spatiotemporal stressor dynamics. We suggest that process‐based and data‐driven models are particularly promising to tackle the challenge of prediction of effects of chemical mixtures and nonchemical stressors on (meta‐)communities and (meta‐)food webs. We propose a framework to integrate the assessment of effects for multiple stressors and chemical mixtures. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;42:1915–1936. © 2023 The Authors.

            "abstract": "Despite the apparent advantages of adaptive plasticity, it is not common. We examined the effects of variation and uncertainty on selection for plasticity using an individual-based computer simulation model. In the model, the environment consisted of a linear gradient of 50 demes with dispersal occurring either before or after selection. Individuals consisted of multiple loci whose phenotypic expression either are affected (plastic) or are not affected (nonplastic) by the environment. Typically, evolution occurred first as genetic differentiation, which was then replaced by the evolution of adaptive plasticity, opposite to the evolutionary trend that is often assumed. Increasing dispersal rates selected for plasticity, if selection occurred before dispersal. If selection occurred after dispersal, the highest plasticity was at intermediate dispersal rates. Temporal variation in the environment occurring after development, but before selection, favored the evolution of plasticity. With dispersal before selection, such temporal variation resulted in hyperplasticity, with a reaction norm much steeper than the optimum. This effect was enhanced with negative temporal autocorrelation and can be interpreted as representing a form of bet hedging. As the number of nonplastic loci increased, plasticity was disfavored due to an increase in the uncertainty of the genomic environment. This effect was reversed with temporal variation. Thus, variation and uncertainty affect whether or not plasticity is favored with different sources of variation—arising from the amount and timing of dispersal, from temporal variation, and even from the genetic architecture underlying the phenotype—having contrasting, interacting, and at times unexpected effects.",

            "abstract": "The environmental risk assessment of pesticides is mainly performed on individual active ingredients. In surface waters within the agricultural landscape, however, contamination is usually characterized by complex pesticide mixtures. To estimate the joint effects caused by these complex mixtures, mathematical models have been proposed. Among these, the model of concentration addition (CA) is suggested as default model for the risk assessment of chemical mixtures as it is considered protective for mixtures composed of similar and dissimilar acting substances. Here we assessed the suitability of CA predictions for seven field relevant pesticide mixtures using acute (immobility) and chronic (reproduction) responses of the standard test species Daphnia magna. Pesticide mixtures indicated largely additive or less than additive effects when using CA model predictions as a reference. Moreover, we revealed that deviations from CA predictions are lower for chronic (up to 3.2-fold) relative to acute (up to 7.2-fold) response variables. Additionally, CA predictions were in general more accurate for complex mixtures relative to those composed of only a few pesticides. Thus, this study suggests CA models as largely protective for the risk assessment of pesticide mixtures justifying its use as default model. At the same time, extrapolating conclusions about the joint effects of pesticides from acute to chronic responses is uncertain, due to partly large discrepancies with regards to the deviation of model prediction and observed effects between exposure scenarios.",

            "abstract": "For the European risk assessment (RA) for soil organisms exposed to plant protection products (PPPs) endpoints from ecotoxicological laboratory studies are compared with predicted environmental concentrations in soil (PECSOIL) at first tier. A safety margin must be met; otherwise, a higher tier RA is triggered (usually soil organism field studies). A new tiered exposure modeling guidance was published by EFSA to determine PECSOIL. This work investigates its potential impact on future soil RA. PECSOIL values for $>$50 active substances and metabolites were calculated and compared with the respective endpoints for soil organisms to calculate the RA failure rate. Compared to the current (FOCUS) exposure modeling, PECSOIL values for all EU regulatory zones considerably increased, e.g., resulting in active substance RA failure rates of 67%, 58% and 36% for modeling Tier-1, Tier-2 and Tier-3A, respectively. The main driving factors for elevated PECSOIL were soil bulk density, crop interception and wash-off, next to obligatory modeling and scenario adjustment factors. Spatial PECSOIL scenario selection procedures result in agronomically atypical soil characteristics (e.g., soil bulk density values in Tier-3A scenarios far below typical European agricultural areas). Consequently, exposure modeling and ecotoxicological study characteristics are inconsistent, which hinders scientifically reasonable comparison of both in the RA.",

            "abstract": "Background: The classification of effects caused by mixtures of agents as synergistic, antagonistic or additive depends critically on the reference model of “null interaction”. Two main approaches are currently in use, the Additive Dose (ADM) or concentration addition (CA) and the Multiplicative Survival (MSM) or independent action (IA) models. We compare several response surface models to a newly developed Hill response surface, obtained by solving a logistic partial differential equation (PDE). Assuming that a mixture of chemicals with individual Hill-type dose-response curves can be described by an n-dimensional logistic function, Hill’s differential equation for pure agents is replaced by a PDE for mixtures whose solution provides Hill surfaces as ’null-interaction’ models and relies neither on Bliss independence or Loewe additivity nor uses Chou’s unified general theory. Methods: An n-dimensional logistic PDE decribing the Hill-type response of n-component mixtures is solved. Appropriate boundary conditions ensure the correct asymptotic behaviour. Mathematica 11 (Wolfram, Mathematica Version 11.0, 2016) is used for the mathematics and graphics presented in this article. Results: The Hill response surface ansatz can be applied to mixtures of compounds with arbitrary Hill parameters. Restrictions which are required when deriving analytical expressions for response surfaces from other principles, are unnecessary. Many approaches based on Loewe additivity turn out be special cases of the Hill approach whose increased flexibility permits a better description of “null-effect” responses. Missing sham-compliance of Bliss IA, known as Colby’s model in agrochemistry, leads to incompatibility with the Hill surface ansatz. Examples of binary and ternary mixtures illustrate the differences between the approaches. For Hill-slopes close to one and doses below the half-maximum effect doses MSM (Colby, Bliss, Finney, Abbott) predicts synergistic effects where the Hill model indicates “null-interaction”. These differences increase considerably with increasing steepness of the individual dose-response curves. Conclusion: The Hill response surface ansatz contains the Loewe additivity concept as a special case and is incompatible with Bliss independent action. Hence, when synergistic effects are claimed, those dose combinations deserve special attention where the differences between independent action approaches and Hill estimations are large.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of earthworms to soil quality and the provision of ecosystem services is widely recognised, however, few studies have tried to quantify the value of their contribution. In this study, we use variables measured in a mesocosm study to value the contribution of earthworms to provisioning and regulating services under both sheep grazed and dairy grazed systems using monetary valuation techniques where possible. The contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services were determined using the relative value differences between two earthworm treatments. Earthworms contributed to a number of ecosystem services. The greatest contribution of earthworms in these pastoral systems was through the provision of food quantity (NZD $356–1,001/ ha). While we recognise the subjectivity and limitations of economic valuation of ecosystem services, we encourage further studies to bridge the gap between soil ecology, farm system analysis and economics, in order to better understand the relative contributions of soil biodiversity to farm systems.",

            "abstract": "Microtiter plate-based assays are a promising technique for toxicity assessment of substances. Chemicals with physicochemical properties such as high volatility and/or high lipophilicity, however, can be lost from the exposure solution during an experiment, so that exposure concentrations are not consistent. The aim of the present study was to determine and reduce the proportion of the reference compounds phenanthrene and phenanthridine lost during exposure in the zebra fish (Danio rerio) embryo test regime. It could be shown that under the standard exposure regime (48 h), the concentration of phenanthrene decreased strongly, by more than 99%, whereas that of phenanthridine decreased by 17% during a 48-h experiment. After modifications to the microtiter plate exposure regime, the phenanthrene concentration showed a decrease of only 40%, while the phenanthridine concentration remained unchanged. The major processes of substance loss could be assigned to accumulations of these substances into the glue of commercially available adhesive foils and the polystyrene walls of the microtiter plates. Furthermore, by investigating the sorption capacity of different plastics, it was found that the phenanthrene concentration decreased less when using a plexiglass specimen (28%) compared with the same-sized polystyrene specimen (94%). Moreover, it was found, for a constant exposure regime, that concentration profiles of different phenanthrene concentrations in the microtiter plate assay during an experiment were similar. A mathematical method is proposed to predict concentration profiles in an exposure solution by scaling a determined profile.",

            "abstract": "Production of surface casts of earthworms (dominantly Allolobophora caliginosa) varied markedly during 1975. Casting activity was restricted to the April to September period and reached a maximum in early June. Seasonal variations in cast production were attributed to fluctuations in soil moisture and temperature, and in food supply. Although the total P content of casts was essentially constant throughout the year, the inorganic P content decreased from a maximum in May to a minimum in August. The progressive decrease in the amount of inorganic P between May and August is attributed to a reduction in the conversion of organic to inorganic P because of the lower microbial and phosphatase enzyme activity as a result of declining soil temperature. Seasonal variations in the release of inorganic P from casts to solution and in the amounts of rapidly-exchangeable P were more closely related to the seasonal pattern of cast production than to changes in the amount of inorganic P in the casts. In contrast, seasonal changes in the release of inorganic P to solution and in the amount of rapidly-exchangeable P in underlying soil were small. A greater amount of inorganic P was extracted by 0.5 M NaHCO, than by water from freshly-deposited casts collected at different times of the year, indicating that NaHCO, extracts some chemisorbed inorganic P from casts. Waterextractable inorganic P accounted for approximately 90% of the difference between inorganic P in casts and underlying soil. Consequently, essentially all of the additional inorganic P in casts is retained by a more-physical sorption type. The results obtained are discussed in terms of the likely effects of surface casting on the P cycle in a soil-plant system.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used to predict how populations respond to changing environments. As the availability of food varies in space and time, individuals should have their own energy budgets, but there is no consensus as to how these should be modelled. Here, we use knowledge of physiological ecology to identify major issues confronting the modeller and to make recommendations about how energy budgets for use in ABMs should be constructed. Our proposal is that modelled animals forage as necessary to supply their energy needs for maintenance, growth and reproduction. If there is sufficient energy intake, an animal allocates the energy obtained in the order: maintenance, growth, reproduction, energy storage, until its energy stores reach an optimal level. If there is a shortfall, the priorities for maintenance and growth/reproduction remain the same until reserves fall to a critical threshold below which all are allocated to maintenance. Rates of ingestion and allocation depend on body mass and temperature. We make suggestions for how each of these processes should be modelled mathematically. Mortality rates vary with body mass and temperature according to known relationships, and these can be used to obtain estimates of background mortality rate. If parameter values cannot be obtained directly, then values may provisionally be obtained by parameter borrowing, pattern-oriented modelling, artificial evolution or from allometric equations. The development of ABMs incorporating individual energy budgets is essential for realistic modelling of populations affected by food availability. Such ABMs are already being used to guide conservation planning of nature reserves and shell fisheries, to assess environmental impacts of building proposals including wind farms and highways and to assess the effects on nontarget organisms of chemicals for the control of agricultural pests.",

            "abstract": "Pesticide use is a major foundation of the agricultural intensification observed over the last few decades. As a result, soil contamination by pesticide residues has become an issue of increasing concern due to some pesticides’ high soil persistence and toxicity to non-target species. In this study, the distribution of 76 pesticide residues was evaluated in 317 agricultural topsoil samples from across the European Union. The soils were collected in 2015 and originated from 11 EU Member States and 6 main cropping systems. Over 80% of the tested soils contained pesticide residues (25% of samples had 1 residue, 58% of samples had mixtures of two or more residues), in a total of 166 different pesticide combinations. Glyphosate and its metabolite AMPA, DDTs (DDT and its metabolites) and the broad-spectrum fungicides boscalid, epoxiconazole and tebuconazole were the compounds most frequently found in soil samples and the compounds found at the highest concentrations. These compounds occasionally exceeded their predicted environmental concentrations in soil but were below the respective toxic endpoints for standard in-soil organisms. Maximum individual pesticide content assessed in a soil sample was 2.05 mg kg−1 while maximum total pesticide content was 2.87 mg kg−1. This study reveals that the presence of mixtures of pesticide residues in soils are the rule rather than the exception, indicating that environmental risk assessment procedures should be adapted accordingly to minimize related risks to soil life and beyond. This information can be used to implement monitoring programs for pesticide residues in soil and to trigger toxicity assessments of mixtures of pesticide residues on a wider range of soil species in order to perform more comprehensive and accurate risk assessments.",

            "abstract": "Sorption, degradation, volatilization, and uptake by test organisms cause concentrations of many toxicants to decline during toxicity testing. Despite the recognition of this occurring, nominal, measured initial or time-averaged concentrations are commonly used for the calculation of inhibitory or effect concentrations from toxicity test data. Because a premise of constant exposure is assumed but not met in these calculations, the toxicity of the test water may be significantly underestimated. Laboratory experiments using a 72-h algal growth inhibition bioassay and copper as a toxicant are used to demonstrate that calculated inhibitory concentrations will often be underestimated twofold if losses of copper occurring over the 72-h test duration are not considered. A simple model is presented for toxicant concentration decline and for the relationship between algal growth rate and toxicant concentration. This model is used to demonstrate the magnitude that calculated inhibitory concentrations may be underestimated if concentration declines are not considered for a series of different concentration decline scenarios. For a toxicant whose concentration declines exponentially to less than 5% of its original value within 36 h of a 72-h test, the inhibitory concentration is shown to be underestimated by a factor of 50.",

            "abstract": "A species may go extinct either because it is unable to evolve rapidly enough to meet changing circumstances, or because its niche disappears and no capacity for rapid evolution could have saved it. Although recent extinctions can usually be interpreted as resulting from niche disappearance, the taxonomic distribution of parthenogens suggests that inability to evolve may also be important. A second distinction is between physical and biotic causes of extinction. Fossil evidence for constant taxonomic diversity, combined with species turnover, implies that biotic factors have been important. A similar conclusion emerges from studies of recent introductions of predators, competitors and parasites into new areas. The term “species selection” should be confined to cases in which the outcome of selection is determined by properties of the population as a whole, rather than of individuals. The process has been of only trivial importance in producing complex adaptations, but of major importance in determining the distribution of different types of organisms. An adequate interpretation of the fossil record requires a theory of the coevolution of many interacting species. Such a theory is at present lacking, but various approaches to it are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how communities of important soil invertebrates vary with land use may lead to the development of more sustainable land-use strategies. We assessed the abundance and species composition of earthworm communities across six replicated long-term experimental ecosystems that span a gradient in agricultural land-use intensity. The experimental systems include a conventional rowcrop agricultural system, two lower-intensity row-crop systems (no-till and tilled organic input), an early successional old-field system, a 40–60 years old coniferous forest plantation, and an old-growth deciduous forest system. Earthworm populations varied among systems; they were lowest in the most intensively managed row-crop system (107 mÀ2) and coniferous forest (160 mÀ2); intermediate in the old-field (273 mÀ2), no-till (328 mÀ2) and tilled organic (344 mÀ2) cropping systems; and highest in the old-growth deciduous forest system (701 mÀ2). Juvenile Aporrectodea species were the most common earthworms encountered in intensively managed systems; other species made up a larger proportion of the community in less intensively managed systems. Earthworm community biomass and species richness also varied and were lowest in the conventional row-crop system and greatest in the old-growth forest system. These results suggest that both land-use intensity and land-use type are strong drivers of the abundance and composition of earthworm communities in agricultural ecosystems.",

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher’s information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the “hat” matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.",

This result is in agreement with predictions from life-cycle models, which indicate that polluted-site populations will be adapted for faster growth, earlier maturation and increased reproductive effort. Life-history adaptation is not however the only explanation for the differences in maturation rates found. During the exposures, mortality of smelter worms was higher than for the reference strain. This resulted in a reduction in the density of the smelter strain. In earthworms, both growth rate and maturation time are known to be density dependent. Thus it is probable that density-mediated responses of growth and development, rather than adaptation, are primarily responsible for the observed life-history.",

            "abstract": "Life-cycle (survival, weight change, and cocoon production rate) and biomarker (neutral-red retention by coelomocytes lysosomes) responses to zinc in four earthworm species were measured in laboratory tests. In all species, dose-dependent effects on survival, cocoon production, and neutral-red retention times were found (one-way ANOVA p Ͻ 0.05). However, for weight change, only Aporrectodea caliginosa showed a clear response. Comparisons of the effects of zinc on these parameters in the different earthworm species indicated similar order of sensitivity. Thus, Lumbricus rubellus and Aporrectodea caliginosa were more sensitive to zinc than Lumbricus terrestris and Eisenia fetida in all cases. To compare the relative sensitivities of life-cycle and biomarker responses, a sublethal sensitivity index (SSI) was applied. For cocoon production, SSIs indicated that the EC10s were below LC50s by a factor of between 8.3 and 16.5. These values are toward the high end of the range found previously for soil invertebrates, indicating an emphasis on maximizing survival. For neutral red, SSIs ranged from 4.5 to 41.2. Thus, the biomarker was predictive of life-cycle effects in some (Lumbricus rubellus and Aporrectodea caliginosa), although not the other two species tested.",

            "abstract": "The inception, ring-testing and standardisation of the acute earthworm toxicity test (OECD 1984), has been at catalyst for the emergence of earthworms as one of the key organisms in (environmental) toxicology. In recognition of this role, there have now been three International Workshops on Earthworm Ecotoxicology (Sheffield in 1991, Amsterdam in 1997 and Åarhus, in 2001). At each workshop delegates met to outline recent work and identify future priorities. At the end of each workshop, recommendations were drawn up both to act as a summary of current knowledge and as initiators for future research. In this paper we briefly review progress in respect of these recommendations. Overall, advances have been made in many areas. Test procedures for laboratory and field toxicity tests have been improved and diversified, thus allowing specific studies not covered by the original OECD (1984) procedure. Further, there is now improved understanding of factors that can modify the effects of chemicals in dynamic ecosystems and also of the mechanistic basis of toxicosis (although many uncertainties still remain in these areas). One notable area where progress has been slower is development of a linked earthworm ecotoxicology community. In particular recommendations to develop comprehensive databases have yet to be implemented.",

Low heritabilities could be because of low additive genetic variation (VA), that had been depleted by directional selection.

Both hypotheses assume that each component of quantitative variation has an independent effect on heritability. However, VA and VR may also covary, in which case differences in heritability cannot be fully explained by the independent effects of elimination-selection or compounded residual variation.",

Among the variety of investigated aspects especially the combined effects of pollution and simultaneous infection on the health of aquatic hosts (molluscs, crustaceans, fish, mammals) is of considerable interest. Effects of pollution on the occurrence and distribution of parasites is another interesting field of “Environmental Parasitology” attracting increasing attention. This mini-review presents some promising examples of interdisciplinary studies paying attention to the fact that under natural conditions no organism will only be affected by either parasites or pollution.",

            "abstract": "In 1983, Russell Lande and Stevan Arnold published “The measurement of selection on correlated characters,” which became a highly influential citation classic in evolutionary biology. This paper stimulated a cottage industry of field studies of natural and sexual selection in nature and resulted in several large-scale meta-analyses, statistical developments, and method papers. The statistical tools they suggested contributed to a breakdown of the traditional dichotomy between ecological and evolutionary time scales and stimulated later developments such as “eco-evolutionary dynamics”. However, regression-based selection analyses also became criticized from philosophical, methodological, and statistical viewpoints and stimulated some still ongoing debates about causality in evolutionary biology. Here I return to this landmark paper by Lande and Arnold, analyze the controversies and debates it gave rise to and discuss the past, present, and future of selection analyses in natural populations. A remaining legacy of Lande & Arnold, 1983 is that studies of selection and inheritance can fruitfully be decoupled and be studied separately, since selection acts on phenotypes regardless of their genetic basis, and hence selection and evolutionary responses to selection are distinct processes.",

Knowledge of the toxicants mode of action is thus required in order to use the models. In order to test the predictive capability of the models, we conducted Daphnia magna 48 h immobilization experiments with three toxicants with known modes of action (dimethoate, pirimicarb and linear alkyl benzene sulfonate) singly, and in binary and ternary mixtures. Our results indicate that CA and IA predict binary mixtures of similar- and dissimilar-acting toxicants equally well. CA and IA also equally predicted the ternary mixture consisting of both similar- and dissimilar-acting chemicals. The paper discusses the concept of mode of action and the implications the definition of mode of action has on the choice of reference model for mixture toxicity studies. r 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Tissue concentrations and intensity of the adverse effect, melamine-cyanurate crystal formation in kidney, were reported in similar experimental conditions. Here, a recent PBTK model for rainbow trout has been applied to model the kinetics of both single compounds based on residue levels in tissues. Both PBTK models for the single compounds were combined and a model of crystal formation for the mixture melamine-cyanuric acid was also added to predict the intensity of crystal formation under the assumptions that crystals formed either in urine or in kidney tissue. Modelling the kinetics of melamine and cyanuric acid provided a better understanding and prediction of intensity of crystal formation in case of sequential exposures with varying intensity or co-exposure.",

            "abstract": "Detection of developmental phenotypes in zebrafish embryos typically involves a visual assessment and scoring of morphological features by an individual researcher. Subjective scoring could impact results and be of particular concern when phenotypic effect patterns are also used as a diagnostic tool to classify compounds. Here we introduce a quantitative morphometric approach based on image analysis of zebrafish embryos. A software called FishInspector was developed to detect morphological features from images collected using an automated system to position zebrafish embryos. The analysis was verified and compared with visual assessments of 3 participating laboratories using 3 known developmental toxicants (methotrexate, dexamethasone, and topiramate) and 2 negative compounds (loratadine and glibenclamide). The quantitative approach exhibited higher sensitivity and made it possible to compare patterns of effects with the potential to establish a grouping and classification of developmental toxicants. Our approach improves the robustness of phenotype scoring and reliability of assay performance and, hence, is anticipated to improve the predictivity of developmental toxicity screening using the zebrafish embryo.",

            "abstract": "The developing cardiovascular system of zebrafish is a sensitive target for many environmental pollutants, including dioxin-like compounds and pesticides. Some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can compromise the cardiovascular endothelial function by activating oxidative stress-sensitive signaling pathways. Therefore, we exposed zebrafish embryos to PCB126 or to several redox-modulating chemicals to study their ability to modulate the dysmorphogenesis produced by PCB126. PCB126 produced a concentration-dependent induction of pericardial edema and circulatory failure, and a concentration-dependent reduction of cardiac output and body length at 80 hours post fertilization (hpf). Among several modulators tested, the effects of PCB126 could be both positively and negatively modulated by different compounds; co-treatment with α-tocopherol (vitamin E liposoluble) prevented the adverse effects of PCB126 in pericardial edema, whereas co-treatment with sodium nitroprusside (a vasodilator compound) significantly worsened PCB126 effects. Gene expression analysis showed an up-regulation of cyp1a, hsp70, and gstp1, indicative of PCB126 interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), while the transcription of antioxidant genes (sod1, sod2; cat and gpx1a) was not affected. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of oxidative stress in the developmental toxicity of low concentrations of PCB126 (25 nM). Our results give insights into the use of zebrafish embryos for exploring mechanisms underlying the oxidative potential of environmental pollutants.",

            "abstract": "No‐observed‐effect concentrations (NOECs) are used in environmental hazard classification and labeling of chemicals and their environmental risk assessment. They are typically obtained using standard tests such as the fish early‐life stage (FELS) toxicity test, the chronic Daphnia reproduction test, and the algae growth inhibition test. Given the demand to replace and reduce animal tests, we explored the impact of the FELS toxicity test on the determination of effect concentrations by comparing the FELS toxicity test and the Daphnia and algae acute or chronic toxicity tests. Lowest‐observedeffect concentrations (LOECs) were used instead of NOECs for better comparison with median lethal or effect concentration data. A database of FELS toxicity data for 223 compounds was established. Corresponding Daphnia and algae toxicity tests were identified using established databases (US Environmental Protection Agency ECOTOX, Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development QSAR Toolbox, eChemPortal, EnviroTox, and OpenFoodTox). Approximately 9.5% of the investigated compounds showed a 10‐fold higher sensitivity with the FELS toxicity test in comparison with the lowest effect concentrations obtained with any of the other tests. Some of these compounds have been known or considered as endocrine disrupting, or are other non‐narcotic chemicals, indicating that the higher sensitivity in the FELS toxicity test is related to a specific mechanism of action. Targeting these mechanisms by alternative test systems or endpoints, using fish embryos for instance, may allow reduction or replacement of the FELS toxicity test or may allow us to prioritize compounds for conduction of the FELS toxicity test.

            "abstract": "Toxicological evaluation of chemicals using early-life stage zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) involves the observation and recording of altered phenotypes. Substantial variability has been observed among researchers in phenotypes reported from similar studies, as well as a lack of consistent data annotation, indicating a need for both terminological and data harmonization. When examined from a data science perspective, many of these apparent differences can be parsed into the same or similar endpoints whose measurements differ only in time, methodology, or nomenclature. Ontological knowledge structures can be leveraged to integrate diverse data sets across terminologies, scales, and modalities. Building on this premise, the National Toxicology Program’s Systematic Evaluation of the Application of Zebrafish in Toxicology undertook a collaborative exercise to evaluate how the application of standardized phenotype terminology improved data consistency. To accomplish this, zebrafish researchers were asked to assess images of zebrafish larvae for morphological malformations in two surveys. In the first survey, researchers were asked to annotate observed malformations using their own terminology. In the second survey, researchers were asked to annotate the images from a list of terms and definitions from the Zebrafish Phenotype Ontology. Analysis of the results suggested that the use of ontology terms increased consistency and decreased ambiguity, but a larger study is needed to confirm. We conclude that utilizing a common data standard will not only reduce the heterogeneity of reported terms but increases agreement and repeatability between different laboratories. Thus, we advocate for the development of a zebrafish phenotype atlas to help laboratories create interoperable, computable data.",

            "abstract": "Management of pests and diseases remains a key issue for agricultural proWtability and environmental health. Moves towards sustainability require a reduction in chemical toxicity loadings and conservation of natural enemies to maintain pest control. There is a lot of information from laboratory tests regarding the eVects of chemicals on beneWcial predators and parasitoids but very few translations of these eVects into Weld impacts particularly under commercial conditions. To address this issue we calculated a chemical toxicity score for 19 commercial vineyards based on IOBC toxicity ratings and application number, and compared this to extensive Weld collections to determine if natural enemy populations can be related to predicted toxicity loadings. Invertebrates were sampled four times during the growing season using canopy sticky traps and ground level pitfall traps. Ordination analyses using non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated community structure in vineyards correlated to site chemical use, while principal components analyses identiWed the taxa involved. One ordination axis from canopy data and two axes from ground level data were correlated to overall IOBC ratings for the vineyards. Principal components analyses indicated that spiders, lacewings, carabids and parasitoids were all aVected by chemical use. IOBC rating based on laboratory studies therefore correlated with chemical eVects on Weld populations of natural enemies in commercial vineyards where complexes of pesticides were applied. The use of chemicals with low toxicity to beneWcials as predicted by IOBC ratings will contribute to preservation and maintenance of natural enemies in vineyard ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The demand for projections of the future distribution of biodiversity has triggered an upsurge in modelling at the crossroads between ecology and evolution. Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions. We hope such a perspective will motivate exciting and novel research, and challenge others to improve on our proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models have been developed for the organophosphorus (OP) insecticides chlorpyrifos (CPF) and diazinon (DZN). It is anticipated that these OPs could interact at a number of important metabolic steps including: CYP450 mediated activation/detoxification, B-esterases [carboxylesterase (CaE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)] or PON-1 (A-esterase) oxon detoxification. We developed a binary PBPK/PD model for CPF, DZN and their metabolites based on previously published models for the individual insecticides. The metabolic interactions (CYP450) between CPF and DZN were evaluated in vitro and suggests that CPF is more substantially metabolized to its oxon metabolite than DZN, which is consistent with observed in vivo potency (CPF $>$ DZN). Each insecticide inhibited the other’s in vitro metabolism in a concentration-dependent manner. The PBPK model code used to describe the metabolism of CPF and DZN was modified to reflect the type of CYP450 inhibition kinetics (i.e. competitive vs. non-competitive), while B-esterase metabolism was described as dose-additive, and no PON-1 interactions were assumed between CPF- and DZN-oxon with the enzyme. The binary model was then evaluated against previously published rodent dosimetry and cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition data for the mixture. The PBPK/PD model simulations of the acute oral exposure to single-mixtures (15 mg/kg) vs. binary-mixtures (15 + 15 mg/kg) of CFP and DZN resulted in no differences in the predicted pharmacokinetics of either the parent OPs or their respective metabolites, while cholinesterase inhibition was reasonably described using the dose-additive model. A binary oral dose of CPF + DZN (60 + 60 mg/kg) did result in observable changes in the DZN pharmacokinetics where Cmax was more reasonably fit by modifying the absorption parameters. It is anticipated that at low environmentally relevant binary doses, most likely to be encountered in occupational or environmental related exposures, that the pharmacokinetics are expected to be linear, and ChE inhibition dose-additive.",

            "abstract": "Due to research advancement and discoveries in the field of medical science, maintains and provides better human health and safer life, which lead to high demand for production of pharmaceutical compounds with a concomitant increase in population. These pharmaceutical (biologically active) compounds were not fully metabolized by the body and excreted out in wastewater. This micro-pollutant remains unchanged during wastewater treatment plant operation and enters into the receiving environment via the discharge of treated water. Persistence of pharmaceutical compounds in both surface and ground waters becomes a major concern due to their potential eco-toxicity. Pharmaceuticals (emerging micropollutants) deteriorate the water quality and impart a toxic effect on living organisms. Therefore, from last two decades, plenty of studies were conducted on the occurrence, impact, and removal of pharmaceutical residues from the environment. This review provides an overview on the fate and removal of pharmaceutical compounds via biological treatment process.",

            "abstract": "Daphnia magna is one of the most commonly used model organism to assess toxicity of wide range of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, anticancer drugs, antidepressants, anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers and lipid-regulating agents. Currently, daphnia toxicity tests based on immobilisation and lethality standardised by OECD, acute immobilisation test and reproduction test, are mainly used in toxicological studies. Detailed analysis of Daphnia biology allows distinguishing the swimming behaviour and physiological endpoints such as swimming speed, distance travelled, hopping frequency, heart rate, ingestion rate, feeding rate, oxygen consumption, thoracic limb activity which could be also useful in assessment of toxic effects. The advantage of behavioural and physiological parameters is the possibility to observe sublethal effects induced by lower concentrations of pharmaceuticals which would not be possible to notice by using OECD tests. Additionally, toxic effects of tested drugs could be assessed using enzymatic and non-enzymatic biomarkers of daphnia toxicity. This review presents scientific data considering characteristics of D. magna, analysis of immobilisation, lethality, reproductive, behavioural, physiological and biochemical parameters used in the toxicity assessment of pharmaceuticals. The aim of this paper is also to emphasize usefulness, advantages and disadvantages of these invertebrate model organisms to assess toxicity of different therapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals. Also, various examples of application of D. magna in studies on pharmaceutical toxicity are presented.",

            "abstract": "Align regulation with environmental reality and policy , Among aspects of agricultural intensification that have been criticized for negative impacts on biodiversity ( 1 , 2 ), pesticides have been linked to declines in insects, birds, and biodiversity in aquatic systems ( 3 – 5 ). If pesticide use is to blame, even partially, then this raises questions both about pesticide use and the regulatory procedures that are used to protect the environment ( 4 ). Environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides does not account for many stressors that have intensified in recent years, such as climate change, habitat destruction, and increasing landscape homogeneity, the combination of which can aggravate effects of pesticides in nature. We describe how several assumptions underlying ERA may not hold in modern intensive agricultural landscapes, and the interaction among assumption violations may account for observed declines in biodiversity. Using European contexts to exemplify these global concerns, we review how regulatory ERA for pesticides has fallen out of step with scientific knowledge ( 4 ) and societal demands for sustainable food production and suggest systematic and recently feasible changes for regulation.",

            "abstract": "Individual differences and variation in behavioural responses have been identified in many animal species. These differences may be the result of genetic or environmental factors or the interaction between them. Analysis of individual differences in behaviour may be important for many reasons. The zebrafish is a powerful model organism that is rapidly gaining popularity in behavioural brain research. However, individual differences have rarely been explored in zebrafish although significant variation in their performance has been reported. In the current study we identified individual differences in activity levels of zebrafish using a genetically heterogeneous population. Groups of zebrafish classified as high, medium, or low activity performers demonstrated consistent activity levels over a period of 7 days, and also in a subsequent open field task, suggesting stable individual differences as opposed to stochastic variation among subjects. We also uncovered a sex dependent relationship between behavioural measures. Female zebrafish in the high activity group preferred the top portion of the tank, whereas low activity females preferred the lower portion but males did not show such a relationship. The relationship between these two behaviours in females implies the potential existence of a behavioural syndrome persisting between contexts. Furthermore, females demonstrated a higher level of consistency in their behaviour as compared to males, and the behavioural differences were found to be independent of both body size and weight of the tested subjects. The identification of individual differences in activity levels in zebrafish will allow the investigation of underlying genetic and/or environmental underpinnings.",

The resulting model predictions fit the observations satisfactorily. Results indicate that food quality and the importance of detritus as a food source are site-specific as well as species-specific. Despite these differences in their calibrated parameter values, both species show a very similar functional response. Compared with other systems, however, the functional responses of mussels in the present study are clearly higher than those of mussels in other systems. This may be explained by the absence of intra-specific competition in the measurement set-up that was used, and therefore supports the idea that the generally small functional response of M. edulis is caused by intra-specific competition.",

Here we report current recommendations from our experiences in zebrafish HTS. We compared the effects of different high throughput chemical delivery methods on nominal water concentration, chemical sorption to multi-well polystyrene plates, transcription responses, and resulting whole animal responses. We demonstrate that digital dispensing consistently yields higher data quality and reproducibility compared to standard plastic tip-based liquid handling. Additionally, we illustrate the challenges in using this sensitive model for chemical assessment when test chemicals have trace impurities. Adaptation of these better practices for zebrafish HTS should increase reproducibility across laboratories.",

The software tools were applied and compared on the problem of updating the parameters of a Diazepam PBPK model, using time-concentration human data. Both tools produced very good fits at the individual and population levels, despite the fact that GNU MCSim is not able to consider multivariate distributions. Stan outperformed GNU MCSim in sampling efficiency, due to its almost uncorrelated sampling. However, GNU MCSim exhibited much faster convergence and performed better in terms of effective samples produced per unit of time.",

            "abstract": "The degree of urbanisation is rapidly increasing worldwide. Due to anthropogenic impact, urban populations are exposed to higher levels of contaminants and higher temperatures. Despite this, urbanisation is a largely overlooked spatial component in ecotoxicology. We tested in a common garden rearing experiment whether replicated urban and rural populations of the damselfly Coenagrion puella differ in their vulnerability to sublethal levels of a widespread pesticide, chlorpyrifos, in terms of ecologically relevant behaviours (exploration behaviour, activity, boldness and food intake), and to what extent these patterns are affected by temperature (20 and 24 ◦C). Except boldness, all behaviours were affected by previous pesticide exposure. While the pesticide did not affect exploration behaviour at 20 ◦C, it was associated with increased exploration at 24 ◦C, which may reflect an increased toxicity of chlorpyrifos at higher temperatures. Importantly, rural and urban larvae showed consistently different, sometimes even opposite behavioural responses to pesticide exposure. When exposed to the pesticide, rural larvae decreased activity and food intake at both temperatures; urban larvae instead increased activity at both temperatures and only reduced food intake at the high temperature. This suggests that urban larvae were less affected by the pesticide, which would be consistent with a scenario of local adaptation to higher contaminant levels. Our results highlight that urbanisation may be an important factor to arrive at a spatially explicit ecological risk assessment, and may be an ignored reason why studies on the same species may generate widely different vulnerabilities to pesticides.",

            "abstract": "The ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) antifungals constitute the most important group of compounds developed for the control of fungal diseases in man. Currently, representatives of two classes of EBI antifungals are available: the squalene epoxidase inhibitors and those that interfere with cytochrome P450-dependent ergosterol synthesis. The allylamines (eg, terbinafine) inhibit squalene epoxidase in sensitive fungi, Trichophyton mentagrophytes being the most sensitive species. The most important developments have come from the introduction of the N-substituted imidazoles and triazoles, the so-called azole antifungals. Most of the currently available imidazoles (eg, miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole) and the triazole derivative terconazole are mainly for topical treatment. Ketoconazole was the first azole derivative orally active against yeasts, dermatophytes and dimorphic fungi. The new triazole, itraconazole, appears to be among the most promising orally active systemic agents. All the azole antifungals inhibit the cytochrome P450-dependent, 14 alpha-demethylase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of ergosterol, the main sterol in most fungal cells. Of all the azoles tested, itraconazole shows the highest affinity for the cytochrome P450 involved. It is about three and ten times more active in vitro than miconazole and the bis-triazole, fluconazole, respectively. Itraconazole’s high affinity for the fungal P450 originates from its triazole group as well as from the nonligating lipophilic tail.",

I further review applications of the DEB model to particular species and discuss what sort of data sets are needed and have been used to estimate the various model parameters. Finally, I argue that more comparative work, i.e. applying DEB models to a wide range of species, is needed, to see whether we can understand the variability in parameter values among species in terms of their ecology and phylogeny.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the high toxicity of neonicotinoids to the survival and reproduction of adult earthworms has become apparent in standard 56‐day toxicity tests. The persistence of some neonicotinoids and/or their repeated application may lead to long‐term exposure, possibly also affecting other parts of the life cycle of earthworms. The present study aimed at providing insight into the sublethal effects of imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and clothianidin on juvenile Eisenia andrei exposed for 16 weeks in Lufa 2.2 soil. Significant effects on growth and maturation were observed for all compounds. Exposure to 0.125 mg imidacloprid/kg dry soil and 0.03125 and 0.0625 mg thiacloprid/kg dry soil significantly affected the growth of the earthworms, while significant maturation effects were observed at 0.03125 mg/kg dry soil for imidacloprid and thiacloprid and 0.25 mg clothianidin/kg dry soil. The 16‐week no‐observed‐effect concentrations (NOECs) found in the present study were lower than previously reported NOECs for effects on earthworm reproduction. Predicted environmental concentrations after a single application exceeded the observed NOECs for effects on earthworm maturation in the case of imidacloprid and thiacloprid and for effects on earthworm growth in the case of thiacloprid and clothianidin.

            "abstract": "Inhaled remdesivir (RDV) reduces viral burden in nonhuman primates infected with SARS-CoV-2., Remdesivir (RDV) is a nucleotide analog prodrug with demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In October 2020, the US FDA approved intravenous (IV) RDV as the first treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, RDV has been approved or authorized for emergency use in more than 50 countries. To make RDV more convenient for non-hospitalized patients earlier in disease, alternative routes of administration are being evaluated. Here, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of RDV administered by head dome inhalation in African green monkeys (AGM). Relative to an IV administration of RDV at 10 mg/kg, an approximately 20-fold lower dose administered by inhalation produced comparable concentrations of the pharmacologically active triphosphate in lower respiratory tract tissues. Distribution of the active triphosphate into the upper respiratory tract was also observed following inhaled RDV exposure. Inhalation RDV dosing resulted in lower systemic exposures to RDV and its metabolites as compared with IV RDV dosing. An efficacy study with repeated dosing of inhaled RDV in an AGM model of SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated reductions in viral replication in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissues compared with placebo. Efficacy was observed with inhaled RDV administered once daily at a pulmonary deposited dose of 0.35 mg/kg beginning approximately 8 hours post-infection. Moreover, the efficacy of inhaled RDV was similar to that of IV RDV administered once at 10 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg daily in the same study. Together, these findings support further clinical development of inhalation RDV.",

            "abstract": "Pleiotropic fitness trade-offs will be key determinants of the evolutionary dynamics of selection for pesticide resistance. However, for herbicide resistance, empirical support for a fitness cost of resistance is mixed, and it is therefore also questionable what further ecological trade-offs can be assumed to apply to herbicide resistance. Here, we test the existence of trade-offs by experimentally evolving herbicide resistance in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Although fitness costs are detected for all herbicides, we find that, counterintuitively, the most resistant populations also have the lowest fitness costs as measured by growth rate in the ancestral environment. Furthermore, after controlling for differences in the evolutionary dynamics of resistance to different herbicides, we also detect significant positive correlations between resistance, fitness in the ancestral environment and cross-resistance to other herbicides. We attribute this to the highest levels of nontarget-site resistance being achieved by fixing mutations that more broadly affect cellular physiology, which results in both more cross-resistance and less overall antagonistic pleiotropy on maximum growth rate. Consequently, the lack of classical ecological trade-offs could present a major challenge for herbicide resistance management.",

            "abstract": "As a neurotoxic insecticide, imidacloprid (IMI) has been widely used for crop protection. However, continuous application of such pesticide in the environment may damage the non-target organisms in soil. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of IMI on earthworms in terms of survival, avoidance behavior, reproduction, detoxification enzyme activity and gene expression using a systematic experimental approach. The results showed that the 14-day LC50 value of IMI was 2.26 (2.09e2.43) mg a.i. kgÀ1, and the 2-day AC50 value (concentration inducing an avoidance rate of 50%) of IMI was 1.34 (1.02 e1.91) mg a.i. kgÀ1 to E. fetida. For reproduction, the 56-day EC50 value of IMI was 0.87 (0.66e1.33) mg a.i. kgÀ1 to E. fetida, and there was a positive correlation between the growth rate of earthworms and the number of juveniles in IMI treatments. Activities of carboxylesterase (CarE) and glutathione-Stransferases (GST) in earthworms were disturbed by IMI exposure. Moreover, effects of IMI on the CarE activity in earthworms were more severe and sensitive compared with the GST activity. The expressions of annetocin (ann) and calreticulin (crt) at the transcriptional level were decreased upon IMI exposure, reaching the lowest levels of 0.09 fold and 0.16 fold on day 7 and day 14, respectively. Transcriptionally controlled tumor protein (tctp), heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and gst exhibited relatively obvious variations (up-regulation or down-regulation) when the exposure duration was extended. Taken together, these results comprehensively contributed to further understandings of the impacts of IMI on earthworms.",

            "abstract": "A diverse laboratory population of Daphnia magna Straus was established by combining individuals from eight sources. Artificial selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was performed, and after eight generations, the average median effective concentration increased from 61 to 180 mg/L. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to first brood, number of offspring in the first brood, or intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmiumadapted population and the controls under ideal conditions or under conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmiumadapted daphnids were smaller. Control and cadmium-adapted populations were equally sensitive to copper and malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Analysis of amplified fragment-length polymorphisms indicated a significant decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population. Although the evolved cadmium resistance would allow adapted populations to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to unadapted populations, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant could reduce the probability of long-term survival even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.",

            "abstract": "A new paradigm for the study of the joint action (synergism, additivity and antagonism) of different agents that combines nonlinear response surface modeling with mixture experiment methodologies is described. We achieve a global nonlinear response surface model using raw data modeling and hierarchical parameter modeling along with numerical and graphical evaluations. The method is applied to a very large previously-published (Faessel et al., 1998) in vitro study of the combined effect of Trimetrexate (TMQ) and AG2034 on inhibition of cancer cell growth. The modulator Folic acid (Folate) concentration is also included as a continuous process variable.

On the basis of this tenet, we developed and tested a new theory that predicts the relationships among three fundamental aspects of life: metabolic rate, growth, and reproduction. We show that the optimization of these processes yields the observed allometries of metazoan life, particularly metabolic scaling. We conclude that metabolism, growth, and reproduction are inextricably linked; that together they determine fitness; and, in contrast to longstanding dogma, that no single component drives another. Our model predicts that anthropogenic change will cause animals to evolve decreased scaling exponents of metabolism, increased growth rates, and reduced lifetime reproductive outputs, with worrying consequences for the replenishment of future populations.",

            "abstract": "Wild populations of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus resident in heavily contaminated North American Atlantic coast estuaries have recently and independently evolved dramatic, heritable, and adaptive pollution tolerance. We compared physiological and transcriptome responses to embryonic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures between one tolerant population and a nearby sensitive population to gain insight into genomic, physiological and biochemical mechanisms of evolved tolerance in killifish, which are currently unknown. The PCB exposure concentrations at which developmental toxicity emerged, the range of developmental abnormalities exhibited, and global as well as specific gene expression patterns were profoundly different between populations. In the sensitive population, PCB exposures produced dramatic, dose-dependent toxic effects, concurrent with the alterations in the expression of many genes. For example, PCB-mediated cardiovascular system failure was associated with the altered expression of cardiomyocyte genes, consistent with sarcomere mis-assembly. In contrast, genome-wide expression was comparatively refractory to PCB induction in the tolerant population. Tolerance was associated with the global blockade of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signalling pathway, the key mediator of PCB toxicity, in contrast to the strong dose-dependent up-regulation of AHR pathway elements observed in the sensitive population. Altered regulation of signalling pathways that cross-talk with AHR was implicated as one candidate mechanism for the adaptive AHR signalling repression and the pollution tolerance that it affords. In addition to revealing mechanisms of PCB toxicity and tolerance, this study demonstrates the value of comparative transcriptomics to explore molecular mechanisms of stress response and evolved adaptive differences among wild populations.",

            "abstract": "Human alterations to the environment can exert strong evolutionary pressures, yet contemporary adaptation to human-mediated stressors is rarely documented in wildlife populations. A common-garden experimental design was coupled with comparative transcriptomics to discover evolved mechanisms enabling three populations of killifish resident in urban estuaries to survive normally lethal pollution exposure during development, and to test whether mechanisms are unique or common across populations. We show that killifish populations from these polluted sites have independently converged on a common adaptive mechanism, despite variation in contaminant profiles among sites. These populations are united by a similarly profound desensitization of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, which is associated with extreme tolerance to the lethal effects of toxic dioxin-like pollutants. The rapid, repeated, heritable and convergent nature of evolved tolerance suggests that ancestral killifish populations harboured genotypes that enabled adaptation to twentieth-century industrial pollutants.",

            "abstract": "Chemical toxins have been a persistent source of evolutionary challenges throughout the history of life, and deep within the genomic storehouse of evolutionary history lay ancient adaptations to diverse chemical poisons. However, the rate of change of contemporary environments mediated by human-introduced pollutants is rapidly screening this storehouse and severely testing the adaptive potential of many species. In this chapter, we briefly review the deep history of evolutionary adaptation to environmental toxins, and then proceed to describe the attributes of stressors and populations that may facilitate contemporary adaptation to pollutants introduced by humans. We highlight that phenotypes derived to enable persistence in polluted habitats may be multi-dimensional, requiring global genome-scale tools and approaches to uncover their mechanistic basis, and include examples of recent progress in the field. The modern tools of genomics offer promise for discovering how pollutants interact with genomes on physiological timescales, and also for discovering what genomic attributes of populations may enable resistance to pollutants over evolutionary timescales. Through integration of these sophisticated genomics tools and approaches with an understanding of the deep historical forces that shaped current populations, a more mature understanding of the mechanistic basis of contemporary ecological-evolutionary dynamics should emerge.",

            "abstract": "For most species, evolutionary adaptation is not expected to be sufficiently rapid to buffer the effects of human-mediated environmental changes, including environmental pollution. Here we review how key features of populations, the characteristics of environmental pollution, and the genetic architecture underlying adaptive traits, may interact to shape the likelihood of evolutionary rescue from pollution. Large populations of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) persist in some of the most contaminated estuaries of the United States, and killifish studies have provided some of the first insights into the types of genomic changes that enable rapid evolutionary rescue from complexly degraded environments. We describe how selection by industrial pollutants and other stressors has acted on multiple populations of killifish and posit that extreme nucleotide diversity uniquely positions this species for successful evolutionary adaptation. Mechanistic studies have identified some of the genetic underpinnings of adaptation to a well-studied class of toxic pollutants; however, multiple genetic regions under selection in wild populations seem to reflect more complex responses to diverse native stressors and/or compensatory responses to primary adaptation. The discovery of these pollution-adapted killifish populations suggests that the evolutionary influence of anthropogenic stressors as selective agents occurs widely. Yet adaptation to chemical pollution in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate wildlife may rarely be a successful “solution to pollution” because potentially adaptive phenotypes may be complex and incur fitness costs, and therefore be unlikely to evolve quickly enough, especially in species with small population sizes.",

            "abstract": "Background: Populations of the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus appear to flourish in heavily polluted and geographically separated Superfund sites. Populations from three Superfund sites (New Bedford Harbor, MA, Newark Bay, NJ, and Elizabeth River, VA) have independently evolved adaptive resistance to chemical pollutants. In these polluted populations, natural selection likely has altered allele frequencies of loci that affect fitness or that are linked to these loci. The aim of this study was to identify loci that exhibit non-neutral behavior in the F. heteroclitus genome in polluted populations versus clean reference populations. Results: To detect signatures of natural selection and thus identify genetic bases for adaptation to anthropogenic stressors, we examined allele frequencies for many hundreds of amplified fragment length polymorphism markers among populations of F. heteroclitus. Specifically, we contrasted populations from three Superfund sites (New Bedford Harbor, MA, Newark Bay, NJ, and Elizabeth River, VA) to clean reference populations flanking the polluted sites. When empirical FST values were compared to a simulated distribution of FST values, 24 distinct outlier loci were identified among pairwise comparisons of pollutant impacted F. heteroclitus populations and both surrounding reference populations. Upon removal of all outlier loci, there was a strong correlation (R2 = 0.79, p $<$ 0.0001) between genetic and geographical distance. This apparently neutral evolutionary pattern was not evident when outlier loci were included (R2 = 0.092, p = 0.0721). Two outlier loci were shared between New Bedford Harbor and Elizabeth River populations, and two different loci were shared between Newark Bay and Elizabeth River populations. Conclusion: In total, 1% to 6% of loci are implicated as being under selection or linked to areas of the genome under selection in three F. heteroclitus populations that reside in polluted estuaries. Shared loci among polluted sites indicate that selection may be acting on multiple loci involved in adaptation, and loci shared between polluted sites potentially are involved in a generalized adaptive response.",

            "abstract": "We present a novel perspective on life-history evolution that combines recent theoretical advances in fluctuating density-dependent selection with the notion of pace-of-life syndromes (POLSs) in behavioural ecology. These ideas posit phenotypic co-variation in life-history, physiological, morphological and behavioural traits as a continuum from the highly fecund, short-lived, bold, aggressive and highly dispersive “fast” types at one end of the POLS to the less fecund, long-lived, cautious, shy, plastic and socially responsive “slow” types at the other. We propose that such variation in life histories and the associated individual differences in behaviour can be explained through their eco-evolutionary dynamics with population density – a single and ubiquitous selective factor that is present in all biological systems. Contrasting regimes of environmental stochasticity are expected to affect population density in time and space and create differing patterns of fluctuating density-dependent selection, which generates variation in fast versus slow life histories within and among populations. We therefore predict that a major axis of phenotypic co-variation in life-history, physiological, morphological and behavioural traits (i.e. the POLS) should align with these stochastic fluctuations in the multivariate fitness landscape created by variation in density-dependent selection. Phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic (co-)variation oriented along this major POLS axis are thus expected to facilitate rapid and adaptively integrated changes in various aspects of life histories within and among populations and/or species. The fluctuating density-dependent selection POLS framework presented here therefore provides a series of clear testable predictions, the investigation of which should further our fundamental understanding of life-history evolution and thus our ability to predict natural population dynamics.",

Survival rate, growth rate, and cocoon number as well as four enzyme (glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)) activities and two proteins (total protein (TP) and metallothionein (MT)) contents in earthworms were determined to characterize the responses of earthworm activity to five soil pH levels. These biological datasets (survival, growth, and reproduction) were compared with biochemical indexes (GSH-PX, SOD, POD, CAT, TP, and MT), mainly using biphasic dose-response models. The results indicated that the soil pH value had significant inhibitory effects on the survival, growth, and reproduction of earthworms beginning with 3.0, 4.0, and 5.2, respectively. The dose-response models (Jshaped and inverted U-shaped curves) statistics indicated that the critical values (ECZEP) of the GSH-PX, SOD, POD, CAT, TP, and MT inhibited by soil acid stress were 3.46, 3.76, 3.35, 3.54, 3.50, and 3.96 (average 3.60), respectively. In the present study, the fitting curve analysis showed that the responses of the CAT activities and TP and MT contents in earthworm in response to soil pH have the behavior of hormesis.",

            "abstract": "Fitness costs constrain the evolution of resistance to environmental stress in populations. We earlier reported on a rapid response to laboratory selection for cadmium resistance in the least killifish (Heterandria formosa). By the sixth generation, the three selection populations were threefold more resistant to cadmium than the control populations. Here, we report the fitness costs and trade-offs associated with this evolution of resistance. In the F3 and F4 generations, the selection populations produced smallersized offspring than the control populations. A comprehensive life-history traits study in the F7 generation showed that the selection populations had, on average, an 18% decrease in fecundity. The selection populations also had a smaller brood size, longer time to first reproduction, and shorter female life expectancy than the control populations. Our results strongly suggest that fitness costs and trade-offs were associated with the evolution of resistance to cadmium in the least killifish. The fitness costs and trade-offs may result from maintenance of the underlying resistance mechanisms, leading to changes in resource allocation in the cadmiumadapted fish.",

            "abstract": "The safety of drinking water is directly related to the occurrence and concentrations of numerous organic micropollutants (OMPs) in source water. In this study, an approach integrating in vitro bioassays and chemical analyses was used to assess the purification effects of a field-scale constructed wetland on the fates of OMPs and their relevant toxicities and health risks in both summer and winter. Overall, 45 of 86 OMPs, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), and phthalates (PAEs), were detected in at least one of the water samples. The constructed wetland significantly decreased the concentrations of most types of OMPs, while showed negative effects on the PAEs and OPPs. Toxicological evaluation of water samples indicated that the cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and anti-androgen (Ant-AR) activity were all dramatically decreased after the constructed wetland treatment. PAEs and PAHs were the dominant contributors and accounted for 75.12–97.48% of the predicted Ant-AR potencies, while the total predicted Ant-AR potencies only contributed 3.13–15.97% of the observed Ant-AR potencies in the examined water samples, suggesting more OMPs that pose toxic effects are still undetected. The human health risk assessment demonstrated that noncarcinogenic risks of the water samples were acceptable. However, potential carcinogenic risks that were mainly induced by 2, 6dinitrotoluene, 2, 4-dinitrotoluene, pentachlorophenol and PAEs cannot be ignored. This study can help to understand the role of constructed wetlands in removing OMPs and biological effects from drinking water sources.",

In order to safeguard human health, threatened species and ecosystems from pesticide pollution, the consumption and pollution of pesticides worldwide especially China were reviewed and documented in present study. Meanwhile, the development trend of pesticide varieties and consumption was also prospected and discussed. It was found that worldwide consumption structure of pesticides has undergone significant changes since 1960s. The proportion of herbicides in pesticide consumption increased rapidly and the consumption of insecticides and fungicides/bactericides declined. China has become the largest pesticide producer and exporter in the world. Pesticide pollution of air, water bodies and soils, and pesticide-induced deaths in China has been serious in past years. Bio-pesticides should be further developed in the future.",

Mortality, tag retention and growth in three groups of juvenile O. stewartii (VIEtagged, CWT-tagged and control) in duplicate were determined in six indoor tanks (300-L/tank volume, 100 fish/tank) at 15.6 ± 0.5°C water temperature. Results showed that neither tagging method had a significant difference on the mortality of the experimental fish, but that the growth rate in the VIE group was significantly lower than in the CWT and control groups. Mean tag retention in the VIE group was 95.2%, and 98.9% in the CWT group, with no significant differences in tag retention in the two methods. The study indicates that both VIE and CWT are suitable short-term tagging methods for hatchery O. stewartii juveniles.",
