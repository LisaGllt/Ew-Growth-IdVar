<section id="abstract" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abstract"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmental risk assessments (ERAs) of chemicals rely on standardized ecotoxicological tests largely overlooking inter-individual variability which is crucial to understand ecological resilience and evolutionary success. Contaminants can disrupt individual differences by altering life-history traits, leading to amplified fitness disparities, favored phenotypes, and a reduced genetic diversity, ultimately affecting population dynamics and its ability to adapt to additional stressors. However, the extent to which pollutants influence inter-individual variability, and how this variability translates into population-level consequences, remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Addressing this gap, our study assesses the inter-individual variability of growth response in the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa to a sublethal exposure to Swing® Gold fungicide, and explores its consequences on individual growth trajectories. Using a longitudinal study design of 30 exposed and 30 unexposed individuals, we compared mean growth rates and inter-individual variability between the two groups. While the fungicide had a weak effect on the cohort’s mean growth rate, we noticed a three-fold increase in inter-individual variability. This increase revealed a subset of highly sensitive individuals with reduced up to 10% compared to the average response.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that focusing on the population mean could overlook effects on the most sensitive individuals, while these may signal early environmental stress. Incorporating individual variability into ecotoxicological studies remains challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of individual monitoring, advanced statistical requirements, and the need for larger datasets. Nevertheless, these efforts are crucial, as these studies could be used into higher-tier ERA framework to refine the safety factors accounting for intraspecies variability when defining regulatory thresholds. Additionally, better understanding of the impact of contaminants on inter-individual variation would improve the accuracy and ecological relevance of risk assessments, while capturing the long-term implications for population and ecosystem dynamics.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Environmental risk assessment of chemicals is based on standardized ecotoxicological tests on various model species of organisms. These tests were designed under the strong assumption that the sensitivity of species is well represented by the sensitivity of individuals on average, with ecotoxicological parameters being defined at the species level. However, inter-individual variations in life history traits, behavior and physiology within a single population has been repeatedly demonstrated by ecologists and evolutionary biologists and can be as strong as among-species differences according to a recent meta-analysis (Des Roches et al., 2018).</p>
<p>These inter-individual variations are critical for the ecological and evolutionary success of populations and species (Des Roches et al., 2018). The origins of these variations within populations are well-documented, encompassing both genetic and environmental factors. The diversity in phenotypic expressions within populations arises from two primary processes: phenotypic plasticity and adaptation (Hendry, 2020). Phenotypic plasticity enables individuals to adjust their phenotype in response to environmental changes during their lifetime. These modifications, while not heritable, allow for rapid and flexible responses to dynamic conditions, enhancing an individual’s immediate survival and performance. In contrast, adaptation results from genetic changes that confer a fitness advantage, allowing beneficial phenotypic traits to become established and passed down across generations. Although this process is slower, it ensures the long-term incorporation of advantageous traits within a population. Together, these mechanisms contribute to a broad spectrum of individual responses to environmental changes, shaping both short-term resilience and long-term evolutionary potential (Debecker &amp; Stoks, 2019). Experimental studies reviewed by Forsman &amp; Wennersten (2016) demonstrated that such variations reduce populations’ fluctuations and vulnerability to environmental changes, enhance colonization success, expand geographic range , and decrease the risk of extinction.</p>
<p>Because the environment partially drives inter-individual differences, anthropogenic stressors, such as pollutants, impose selective pressures on chemically exposed populations, often leading to accelerated phenotypic changes (Sanderson et al., 2022). Pollutants disrupt normal physiological and developmental processes, altering life-history traits and behaviors with cascading effects on population dynamics and ecosystem health (Brown et al., 2009; Relyea &amp; Hoverman, 2006). Although adaptation to pollutants can offer short-term survival benefits, it often entails costs, including reduced genetic variability and fitness trade-offs that impair tolerance to secondary stressors (Coutellec &amp; Barata, 2011). In classical ecotoxicology studies, inter-individual variability is rarely studied as a phenomenon of interest. Most approaches rely heavily on standardized tests with standardized organisms and small sample sizes, further restricting the estimation of intra-population variability (Jager, 2013). It is also the case in biomarker studies, with the choice of low-variability indicators to enhance the detection of contaminant effects (Depledge &amp; Fossi, 1994; Jemec et al., 2010). While practical, this approach limits the understanding of individual differences and their ecological significance. And even when differences in sensitivity are acknowledged, such as an observed variation of maximum size reductions in Folsomia candida exposed to cadmium (Jager, 2013), these variations are rarely incorporated as endpoints in regulatory risk assessments. In contrast, behavioral ecotoxicology has advanced in addressing individual variability. Research has shown that contaminants can alter individual behaviors across taxa, including spiders, odonates, and fish, exposed to substances like pesticides and anxiolytics (Polverino et al., 2021; Royauté et al., 2015). However, the magnitude and direction of these effects vary drastically from study to study, emphasizing the importance of accounting for personality traits (Réale et al., 2007) and their disruption by pollutants. Behavioral studies have adopted statistical tools, such as reaction norm-based approaches and hierarchical models, to capture and analyze inter-individual variability. Statistical hierarchical models incorporate individual-level data and allow for the estimation of inter-individual variations through the use of hyperparameters (Feller &amp; Gelman, 2015). These models can provide a more detailed and accurate representation of a population’s sensitivity to a pollutant by accounting for variability in exposure, and response among individuals. Despite the importance of these individual differences, ecotoxicology traditionally focused on species-level responses, and considered individual variations as noise. This typically leads to the reporting of only one single parameter value for a given species, overlooking the range of potential responses within the studied populations. Consequently, environmental risk assessments (ERAs) based on average responses at population level, may underestimate the actual impact of contaminants, particularly when subpopulations of more sensitive individuals are present. Consequently, there is a growing consensus among researchers that inter-individual variation should be incorporated as a critical endpoint in ecotoxicological studies. Acknowledging and quantifying these variations can improve the predictive power of ecotoxicological models and provide a more accurate assessment of the ecological risks associated with contaminant exposure (Jager, 2013; Nikinmaa et al., 2019). By incorporating individual variability into population dynamics models, researchers can account for the diverse range of responses to environmental stressors within a population. This approach is particularly valuable for long-term risk assessments that consider chronic exposures and sub-lethal effects, as variability in traits such as growth, reproduction, and survival can influence the resilience or vulnerability of a population, potentially altering its trajectory under continuous exposure to contaminants, leading to shifts in community structure and function. By integrating this variability, models provide a more accurate depiction of population-level outcomes, helping to forecast potential ecological consequences of contaminant exposure more reliably (Oziolor et al., 2020; Forbes et al., 2011).</p>
<p>The present study focuses on estimating the inter-individual variations of the impact of pesticides on earthworms. Earthworms are key organisms for soil functioning, contributing to air and water flow regulation, soil structuration, and organic matter decomposition. Given their ecological niche, earthworms are particularly vulnerable to pesticide residues in soils, and pesticides have been implicated in the decline of earthworm biodiversity in conventionally managed agricultural fields (Bertrand et al., 2024). We specifically focus on Aporrectodea caliginosa, a model species used in ecotoxicology; which is ubiquist in agricultural fields (Bart et al., 2018). A. caliginosa is also one of the model species for ISO ecotoxicological tests (ISO 11268-2:2023).</p>
<p>We aimed to investigate how inter-individual variations in earthworm growth are affected by pesticide exposure and discuss their implications for environmental risk assessment (ERA). To do so, we conducted a longitudinal study with two treatments: one control and one with a sub-lethal dose of a cocktail of epoxiconazole and dimoxystrobin, two active substances found in the plant protection product Swing® Gold. This fungicide has known effects on A. caliginosa growth and reproduction (Bart et al., 2019, 2020). Because of natural phenotypic diversity, individual variation is already expected in the non exposed cohort. We expected a decrease in the average individual growth rate in the fungicide cocktail. We also hypothesized an effect of pesticides exposure on individual variation but with no a priori on the direction of the pesticide effect, as empirical results cited above support both cases (Figure 1). Additionally, we assessed how our results compare to current best practices for ecotoxicity tests on soil organism growth, which typically involve fewer replicates. Using a resampling procedure, we examined whether a reduced sample size would have altered our estimates, potentially leading to inaccurate or even misleading conclusions. We anticipated that standard replicate numbers may not be sufficient to accurately capture both variability and mean growth, increasing the risk of overlooking a particularly sensitive subset of the population.</p>

Figure&nbsp;2.1: Different scenarios of how pesticides exposure may alter individual differences in growth under the general hypothesis that average growth is reduced by the exposition. Case 1 describes a diminution of individual differences that may be due to the additional constraints from the exposition, leading to a low overlap in growth trajectories between the two groups. Case 2 describes an amplification of individual differences that may be due to the additional variation of individual responses to the fungicide exposure, leading to a strong overlap in growth trajectories between the two groups.

<span id="cb6-22"><a href="#cb6-22" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Environmental risk assessments (ERAs) of chemicals rely on standardized ecotoxicological tests largely overlooking inter-individual variability which is crucial to understand ecological resilience and evolutionary success. Contaminants can disrupt individual differences by altering life-history traits, leading to amplified fitness disparities, favored phenotypes, and a reduced genetic diversity, ultimately affecting population dynamics and its ability to adapt to additional stressors. However, the extent to which pollutants influence inter-individual variability, and how this variability translates into population-level consequences, remains poorly understood.</span>

<span id="cb6-24"><a href="#cb6-24" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Addressing this gap, our study assesses the inter-individual variability of growth response in the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa to a sublethal exposure to Swing® Gold fungicide, and explores its consequences on individual growth trajectories. Using a longitudinal study design of 30 exposed and 30 unexposed individuals, we compared mean growth rates and inter-individual variability between the two groups. While the fungicide had a weak effect on the cohort’s mean growth rate, we noticed a three-fold increase in inter-individual variability. This increase revealed a subset of highly sensitive individuals with reduced up to 10% compared to the average response.</span>

<span id="cb6-26"><a href="#cb6-26" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Our results indicate that focusing on the population mean could overlook effects on the most sensitive individuals, while these may signal early environmental stress. Incorporating individual variability into ecotoxicological studies remains challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of individual monitoring, advanced statistical requirements, and the need for larger datasets. Nevertheless, these efforts are crucial, as these studies could be used into higher-tier ERA framework to refine the safety factors accounting for intraspecies variability when defining regulatory thresholds. Additionally, better understanding of the impact of contaminants on inter-individual variation would improve the accuracy and ecological relevance of risk assessments, while capturing the long-term implications for population and ecosystem dynamics.</span>

<span id="cb6-30"><a href="#cb6-30" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Environmental risk assessment of chemicals is based on standardized ecotoxicological tests on various model species of organisms. These tests were designed under the strong assumption that the sensitivity of species is well represented by the sensitivity of individuals on average, with ecotoxicological parameters being defined at the species level. However, inter-individual variations in life history traits, behavior and physiology within a single population has been repeatedly demonstrated by ecologists and evolutionary biologists and can be as strong as among-species differences according to a recent meta-analysis (Des Roches et al., 2018).</span>
<span id="cb6-31"><a href="#cb6-31" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-32"><a href="#cb6-32" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>These inter-individual variations are critical for the ecological and evolutionary success of populations and species (Des Roches et al., 2018). The origins of these variations within populations are well-documented, encompassing both genetic and environmental factors. The diversity in phenotypic expressions within populations arises from two primary processes: phenotypic plasticity and adaptation (Hendry, 2020). Phenotypic plasticity enables individuals to adjust their phenotype in response to environmental changes during their lifetime. These modifications, while not heritable, allow for rapid and flexible responses to dynamic conditions, enhancing an individual’s immediate survival and performance. In contrast, adaptation results from genetic changes that confer a fitness advantage, allowing beneficial phenotypic traits to become established and passed down across generations. Although this process is slower, it ensures the long-term incorporation of advantageous traits within a population. Together, these mechanisms contribute to a broad spectrum of individual responses to environmental changes, shaping both short-term resilience and long-term evolutionary potential (Debecker &amp; Stoks, 2019). Experimental studies reviewed by Forsman &amp; Wennersten (2016) demonstrated that such variations reduce populations’ fluctuations and vulnerability to environmental changes, enhance colonization success, expand geographic range , and decrease the risk of extinction.</span>
<span id="cb6-33"><a href="#cb6-33" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-34"><a href="#cb6-34" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Because the environment partially drives inter-individual differences, anthropogenic stressors, such as pollutants, impose selective pressures on chemically exposed populations, often leading to accelerated phenotypic changes (Sanderson et al., 2022). Pollutants disrupt normal physiological and developmental processes, altering life-history traits and behaviors with cascading effects on population dynamics and ecosystem health (Brown et al., 2009; Relyea &amp; Hoverman, 2006). Although adaptation to pollutants can offer short-term survival benefits, it often entails costs, including reduced genetic variability and fitness trade-offs that impair tolerance to secondary stressors (Coutellec &amp; Barata, 2011). In classical ecotoxicology studies, inter-individual variability is rarely studied as a phenomenon of interest. Most approaches rely heavily on standardized tests with standardized organisms and small sample sizes, further restricting the estimation of intra-population variability (Jager, 2013). It is also the case in biomarker studies, with the choice of low-variability indicators to enhance the detection of contaminant effects (Depledge &amp; Fossi, 1994; Jemec et al., 2010). While practical, this approach limits the understanding of individual differences and their ecological significance. And even when differences in sensitivity are acknowledged, such as an observed variation of maximum size reductions in Folsomia candida exposed to cadmium (Jager, 2013), these variations are rarely incorporated as endpoints in regulatory risk assessments. In contrast, behavioral ecotoxicology has advanced in addressing individual variability. Research has shown that contaminants can alter individual behaviors across taxa, including spiders, odonates, and fish, exposed to substances like pesticides and anxiolytics (Polverino et al., 2021; Royauté et al., 2015). However, the magnitude and direction of these effects vary drastically from study to study, emphasizing the importance of accounting for personality traits (Réale et al., 2007) and their disruption by pollutants. Behavioral studies have adopted statistical tools, such as reaction norm-based approaches and hierarchical models, to capture and analyze inter-individual variability. Statistical hierarchical models incorporate individual-level data and allow for the estimation of inter-individual variations through the use of hyperparameters (Feller &amp; Gelman, 2015). These models can provide a more detailed and accurate representation of a population’s sensitivity to a pollutant by accounting for variability in exposure, and response among individuals. Despite the importance of these individual differences, ecotoxicology traditionally focused on species-level responses, and considered individual variations as noise. This typically leads to the reporting of only one single parameter value for a given species, overlooking the range of potential responses within the studied populations. Consequently, environmental risk assessments (ERAs) based on average responses at population level, may underestimate the actual impact of contaminants, particularly when subpopulations of more sensitive individuals are present. Consequently, there is a growing consensus among researchers that inter-individual variation should be incorporated as a critical endpoint in ecotoxicological studies. Acknowledging and quantifying these variations can improve the predictive power of ecotoxicological models and provide a more accurate assessment of the ecological risks associated with contaminant exposure (Jager, 2013; Nikinmaa et al., 2019). By incorporating individual variability into population dynamics models, researchers can account for the diverse range of responses to environmental stressors within a population. This approach is particularly valuable for long-term risk assessments that consider chronic exposures and sub-lethal effects, as variability in traits such as growth, reproduction, and survival can influence the resilience or vulnerability of a population, potentially altering its trajectory under continuous exposure to contaminants, leading to shifts in community structure and function. By integrating this variability, models provide a more accurate depiction of population-level outcomes, helping to forecast potential ecological consequences of contaminant exposure more reliably (Oziolor et al., 2020; Forbes et al., 2011).</span>

<span id="cb6-36"><a href="#cb6-36" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The present study focuses on estimating the inter-individual variations of the impact of pesticides on earthworms. Earthworms are key organisms for soil functioning, contributing to air and water flow regulation, soil structuration, and organic matter decomposition. Given their ecological niche, earthworms are particularly vulnerable to pesticide residues in soils, and pesticides have been implicated in the decline of earthworm biodiversity in conventionally managed agricultural fields (Bertrand et al., 2024). We specifically focus on Aporrectodea caliginosa, a model species used in ecotoxicology; which is ubiquist in agricultural fields (Bart et al., 2018). A. caliginosa is also one of the model species for ISO ecotoxicological tests (ISO 11268-2:2023).</span>
<span id="cb6-37"><a href="#cb6-37" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb6-38"><a href="#cb6-38" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We aimed to investigate how inter-individual variations in earthworm growth are affected by pesticide exposure and discuss their implications for environmental risk assessment (ERA). To do so, we conducted a longitudinal study with two treatments: one control and one with a sub-lethal dose of a cocktail of epoxiconazole and dimoxystrobin, two active substances found in the plant protection product Swing® Gold. This fungicide has known effects on A. caliginosa growth and reproduction (Bart et al., 2019, 2020). Because of natural phenotypic diversity, individual variation is already expected in the non exposed cohort. We expected a decrease in the average individual growth rate in the fungicide cocktail. We also hypothesized an effect of pesticides exposure on individual variation but with no a priori on the direction of the pesticide effect, as empirical results cited above support both cases (Figure 1). Additionally, we assessed how our results compare to current best practices for ecotoxicity tests on soil organism growth, which typically involve fewer replicates. Using a resampling procedure, we examined whether a reduced sample size would have altered our estimates, potentially leading to inaccurate or even misleading conclusions. We anticipated that standard replicate numbers may not be sufficient to accurately capture both variability and mean growth, increasing the risk of overlooking a particularly sensitive subset of the population.</span>

Case 2 describes an amplification of individual differences that may be due to the additional variation of individual responses to the fungicide exposure, leading to a strong overlap in growth trajectories between the two groups.</span></span>
